Customers may delay delivery of\\nproducts or cancel orders prior to shipment, subject to possible cancellation penalties. Delays in delivery schedules\\nor a reduction of backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse e\\ufb00ect on Applied\\u2019s business\\nand results of operations.\\nManufacturing, Raw Materials and Supplies\\nApplied\\u2019s worldwide manufacturing activities consist primarily of assembly, integration and test of various\\nproprietary and commercial parts, components and subassemblies that are used to manufacture systems. Applied\\nhas implemented a distributed manufacturing model under which manufacturing and supply chain activities are\\nconducted in various countries, primarily including China, Israel, Singapore, Taiwan, the United States and other\\ncountries in Asia. Applied uses quali\\ufb01ed vendors, including contract manufacturers, to supply parts, services and\\nproduct support. Applied\\u2019s supply chain strategy commits to adhere to ethical labor practices, responsible minerals\\nsourcing, Responsible Business Alliance and SEMI guidelines, and the Applied Materials Standards of Business\\nConduct as de\\ufb01ned in Applied\\u2019s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) commitment.\\nAlthough Applied makes reasonable e\\ufb00orts to assure that parts are available from multiple quali\\ufb01ed suppliers,\\nthis is not always possible. Accordingly, some key parts may be obtained from only a quali\\ufb01ed single supplier or a\\nlimited group of quali\\ufb01ed suppliers. Applied seeks to reduce costs and to lower the risks of manufacturing and\\nservice interruptions by selecting and qualifying alternate suppliers for parts; monitoring the \\ufb01nancial condition of\\nkey suppliers; maintaining appropriate inventories of parts; qualifying new parts on a timely basis; and ensuring\\nquality and performance of parts.\\nResearch, Development and Engineering\\nApplied\\u2019s long-term growth strategy requires continued development of new materials engineering\\ncapabilities, including products and platforms that enable expansion into new and adjacent markets. Applied\\u2019s\\nsigni\\ufb01cant investments in research, development and engineering (RD&E) must generally enable it to deliver new\\nproducts and technologies before the emergence of strong demand, thus allowing customers to incorporate these\\nproducts into their manufacturing plans during early-stage technology selection. Applied works closely with its\\nglobal customers and ecosystem partners to design systems and processes that meet planned technical and\\nproduction requirements.\\nApplied\\u2019s product development and engineering organizations are located primarily in the United States, as\\nwell as in China, Europe, India, Israel, Korea, Singapore and Taiwan. In addition, certain outsourced RD&E activities,\\nprocess support and customer demonstrations are performed in the United States, India, China, Singapore and\\nTaiwan.\\n8 Table of Contents\\nMarketing and Sales\\nBecause of the highly technical nature of its products, Applied markets and sells products worldwide almost\\nentirely through a direct sales force.\\nApplied has operations in many countries, with some of its business activities concentrated in certain\\ngeographic areas, and global and regional economic and political conditions can impact the company\\u2019s business\\nand \\ufb01nancial results. Applied\\u2019s business is based on capital equipment investments by major semiconductor,\\ndisplay and other manufacturers, and is subject to signi\\ufb01cant variability in customer demand for Applied\\u2019s\\nproducts. Customers\\u2019 expenditures depend on many factors, including: general economic conditions; anticipated\\nmarket demand and pricing for semiconductors, display technologies and other electronic devices; the\\ndevelopment of new technologies; customers\\u2019 factory utilization; capital resources and \\ufb01nancing; trade policies and\\nexport regulations; and government incentives. In addition, a signi\\ufb01cant driver in the semiconductor and display\\nindustries has been end-demand for mobile consumer products, which has been characterized by seasonality that\\nimpacts the timing of customer investments in manufacturing equipment and, in turn, Applied\\u2019s business.\\nInformation on net sales to una\\ufb03liated customers and long-lived assets attributable to Applied\\u2019s geographic\\nregions is included in Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Applied\\u2019s ability to compete generally depends on its ability to commercialize its technology in a timely\\nmanner, continually improve its products, and develop new products that meet constantly evolving customer\\nrequirements. Signi\\ufb01cant competitive factors include technical capability and di\\ufb00erentiation, productivity, cost-\\ne\\ufb00ectiveness and the ability to support a global customer base. The importance of these factors varies according to\\ncustomers\\u2019 needs, including product mix and respective product requirements, applications, and the timing and\\ncircumstances of purchasing decisions. Substantial competition exists in all areas of Applied\\u2019s business.\\nCompetitors range from small companies that compete in a single region, which may bene\\ufb01t from policies and\\nregulations that favor domestic companies, to global, diversi\\ufb01ed companies, which operate in more complex global\\neconomic and regulatory environments. Applied\\u2019s ability to compete requires a high level of investment in RD&E,\\nmarketing and sales, and global customer support activities. Management believes that many of Applied\\u2019s products\\nhave strong competitive positions.\\nThe competitive environment for each segment is described below.\\nThe semiconductor industry is driven by demand for advanced electronic products, including smartphones and\\nother mobile devices, servers, personal computers, automotive electronics, storage, and other products. The\\ngrowth of data and emerging end-market drivers such as arti\\ufb01cial intelligence, the Internet of Things, 5G networks,\\nsmart vehicles and augmented and virtual reality are also creating the next wave of growth for the industry. As a\\nresult, products within the Semiconductor Systems segment are subject to signi\\ufb01cant changes in customer\\nrequirements, including transitions to smaller dimensions, increasingly complex chip architectures, new materials\\nand an increasing number of applications. While certain existing technologies may be adapted to new\\nrequirements, some applications create the need for an entirely di\\ufb00erent technological approach. The rapid pace of\\ntechnological change can quickly diminish the value of current technologies and products and create opportunities\\nfor existing and new competitors. Applied\\u2019s broad portfolio o\\ufb00ers a variety of di\\ufb00erentiated products, including co-\\noptimized and integrated materials solutions that enable unique \\ufb01lms, structures and devices. Applied\\u2019s products\\nmust continuously evolve to satisfy customers\\u2019 requirements to compete e\\ufb00ectively in the marketplace. Applied\\nallocates resources among its numerous product o\\ufb00erings and therefore may decide not to invest in an individual\\nproduct depending on market requirements. There are a number of competitors serving the semiconductor\\nmanufacturing equipment industry, which has experienced increased consolidation. Some of these competitors\\no\\ufb00er a single product line and others o\\ufb00er multiple product lines, and range from serving a single region to global,\\ndiversi\\ufb01ed companies.\\nProducts and services within the Applied Global Services segment complement the Semiconductor Systems\\nand Display and Adjacent Markets segments\\u2019 products in markets that are characterized by demanding worldwide\\nservice requirements. Competition in the Applied Global Services segment includes a diverse group of numerous\\nthird-party service providers and customers that perform their own service.\\nTo compete e\\ufb00ectively, Applied o\\ufb00ers products and services to improve tool performance, lower overall cost of\\nownership, and increase yields and productivity of customers\\u2019 fab operations. Signi\\ufb01cant competitive factors\\ninclude productivity, cost-e\\ufb00ectiveness, and the level of technical service and support. The importance of these\\nfactors varies according to customers\\u2019 needs and the type of products or services o\\ufb00ered.\\nProducts in the Display and Adjacent Markets segment are generally subject to strong competition from a\\nnumber of major competitors primarily in Asia. Applied holds established market positions with its technically-\\ndi\\ufb00erentiated LCD and OLED manufacturing solutions for PECVD, color \\ufb01lter PVD, PVD array, PVD touch panel, and\\nTFT array testing, although its market position could change quickly due to customers\\u2019 evolving requirements.\\nImportant factors a\\ufb00ecting the competitive position of Applied\\u2019s Display and Adjacent Markets products include:\\nindustry trends, Applied\\u2019s ability to innovate and develop new products, and the extent to which Applied\\u2019s products\\nare technically-di\\ufb00erentiated, as well as which customers within a highly concentrated customer base are making\\ncapital equipment investments and Applied\\u2019s existing position at these customers.\\n10 Table of Contents\\nPatents and Licenses\\nProtection of Applied\\u2019s technology assets through enforcement of its intellectual property rights, including\\npatents, is important for its competitive position. Applied\\u2019s practice is to \\ufb01le patent applications in the United\\nStates and other countries for inventions that it considers signi\\ufb01cant. Applied has more than 17,300 patents in the\\nUnited States and other countries, and additional applications are pending for new inventions. Although Applied\\ndoes not consider its business materially dependent upon any one patent, the rights of Applied and the products\\nmade and sold under its patents, taken as a whole, are a signi\\ufb01cant element of its business. In addition to its\\npatents, Applied possesses other intellectual property, including trademarks, know-how, trade secrets, and\\ncopyrights.\\nApplied enters into patent and technology licensing agreements with other companies when it is determined\\nto be in its best interest. Applied pays royalties under existing patent license agreements for the use, in several of\\nits products, of certain patented technologies. Applied also receives royalties from licenses granted to third parties.\\nRoyalties received from or paid to third parties have not been material to Applied\\u2019s consolidated results of\\noperations.\\nIn the normal course of business, Applied periodically receives and makes inquiries regarding possible patent\\ninfringement. In responding to such inquiries, it may become necessary or useful for Applied to obtain or grant\\nlicenses or other rights. However, there can be no assurance that such licenses or rights will be available to Applied\\non commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If Applied is not able to resolve or settle claims, obtain necessary\\nlicenses on commercially reasonable terms, or successfully prosecute or defend its position, Applied\\u2019s business,\\n\\ufb01nancial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely a\\ufb00ected.\\nGovernmental Regulation\\nAs a public company with global operations, Applied is subject to the laws and regulations of the United States\\nand multiple foreign jurisdictions. These regulations, which di\\ufb00er among jurisdictions, include those related to\\n\\ufb01nancial and other disclosures, accounting standards, corporate governance, intellectual property, tax, trade,\\nincluding import, export and customs, antitrust, environment, and health and safety, climate change, employment,\\nimmigration and travel regulations, privacy, data protection and localization, and anti-corruption. See \\u201cRisk Factors\\n\\u2013 Legal, Compliance, and Other Risks \\u2013 Applied is exposed to various risks related to the global regulatory\\nenvironment\\u201d for further details.\\nApplied is regulated under various international laws regarding the purchase and sale of goods and related\\nitems, including but not limited to those related to trade policies and export regulations, and limitations on transfer\\nof intellectual property. See \\u201cRisk Factors \\u2013 Business and Industry Risks \\u2013 Global trade issues and changes in and\\nuncertainties with respect to trade policies and export regulations, including import and export license\\nrequirements, trade sanctions, tari\\ufb00s and international trade disputes, have adversely impacted and could further\\nadversely impact our business and operations, and reduce the competitiveness of our products relative to local and\\nglobal competitors\\u201d for further details.\\nWith respect to environmental, health and safety regulations, Applied maintains a number of programs that\\nare primarily preventative in nature and regularly monitors ongoing compliance with applicable laws and\\nregulations. In addition, Applied has trained personnel to conduct investigations of any environmental, health, or\\nsafety incidents, including, but not limited to, spills, releases, or possible contamination. See also \\u201cRisk Factors \\u2013\\nRisks Related to Legal, Compliance, and Other Risks \\u2013 Applied is subject to risks associated with environmental,\\nhealth and safety regulations\\u201d for further details.\\nApplied is subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. Applied\\u2019s provision for income\\ntaxes, e\\ufb00ective tax rate and \\ufb01nancial results could be a\\ufb00ected by numerous factors, including changes in\\napplicable tax laws, interpretations of applicable tax laws, amount and composition of pre-tax income in\\njurisdictions with di\\ufb00ering tax rates, and valuation of deferred tax assets. There have been a number of proposed\\nchanges in the tax laws that could increase Applied\\u2019s tax liability.

Applied\\u2019s ability to create di\\ufb00erentiated value in the marketplace is\\ndriven by the capability of the Company\\u2019s people to anticipate technology in\\ufb02ections and integrate customer\\nrequirements. To achieve this level of value creation, Applied believes it must attract, hire, develop and retain a\\nworld-class global workforce. The Company invests in its employees by providing quality training and learning\\nopportunities; promoting inclusion, equity and diversity; and upholding a high standard of ethics and respect for\\nhuman rights.\\nAs of October 30, 2022, Applied employed approximately 33,000 regular full-time employees, of whom\\napproximately 46%, 42% and 12% resided in the Asia-Paci\\ufb01c region, North America, and Europe, Middle East and\\nAfrica, respectively. Applied\\u2019s team spans 24 countries, re\\ufb02ecting various cultures, backgrounds, race, color,\\nnational origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, ages, and disability, veteran and military status.\\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\\nApplied values great talent and di\\ufb00erent perspectives, knowing that diversity is one of its greatest strengths.\\nThe Company therefore strives to provide fair and equal opportunity for career development and advancement to\\nall its employees and incorporates respect for diverse backgrounds and perspectives into the Company\\u2019s culture at\\nevery level \\u2013 from strategy and policy down to everyday interactions.\\nApplied expects that its commitment to strengthening the Company\\u2019s culture of inclusion will broaden the\\ndiversity of its workplace and help Applied build a culture that bene\\ufb01ts everyone. In recent years, Applied\\ncontinued to make progress in its culture of inclusion journey, including, among other things, expanding gender\\ndiversity on the Company\\u2019s Board to 40% female membership, increasing female representation in the U.S. and\\nglobal workforce, and increasing U.S. underrepresented minority representation. As of October 30, 2022, Applied\\u2019s\\nglobal workforce was 80.6% male and 19.4% female, and 19% of Applied\\u2019s workforce in the United States was\\ncomposed of underrepresented minorities.\\nAdditionally, Applied is investing in inclusion learning experiences. For example, the Company has various\\ninitiatives to further develop its leaders to lead even more inclusively and further deepen engagement with\\nemployees.\\nTalent Acquisition and Retention\\nApplied believes that its future success is highly dependent upon the Company\\u2019s continued ability to attract,\\ndevelop, retain and engage employees. As part of the Company\\u2019s e\\ufb00ort to attract and retain employees, Applied\\no\\ufb00ers competitive rewards, compensation and bene\\ufb01ts, including an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, healthcare and\\nretirement bene\\ufb01ts, parental and family leave, adoption credits, holiday and paid time o\\ufb00, and tuition assistance.\\nEmployee Learning & Development\\nApplied seeks to create growth and development opportunities to support an engaged and inclusive workforce.\\nApplied promotes holistic employee learning and development based on the 70/20/10 model--70% on-the-job\\nlearning, 20% social/collaborative and 10% formal training, with a focus on advancing technical skills as well as\\nimproving general business acumen to address increasing work complexity. Also, to help expand professional\\nbreadth, Applied uses a federated model where the segments and functions provide technical and job-speci\\ufb01c\\ntraining tied to their disciplines, while general professional, management, and leadership training is provided at the\\ncorporate level. All training is coordinated centrally and aligned with common objectives through Applied Global\\nUniversity. In addition to instructor-led and web-based training, Applied o\\ufb00ers state-of-the-art training modalities,\\nsuch as AI-based simulations and Augmented and Virtual Reality learning capabilities, to help develop its new\\nproducts, train its manufacturing and \\ufb01eld support employees, and collaborate remotely. Each \\ufb01scal year,\\nemployees are provided the opportunity to complete the required 40 hours of learning.\\nEmployee Engagement, Organizational Health and Pandemic Response\\nApplied has historically managed and measured employee engagement and organizational health with a view\\nto gaining insight into employees\\u2019 experiences, levels of workplace satisfaction, and feelings of engagement and\\ninclusion.\\nSince the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Applied\\u2019s top priority remains protecting the health and safety of\\nits employees and their families, customers, suppliers and community. This includes an understanding of its\\nemployees\\u2019 engagement and experiences during the pandemic and developing a return to work and future of work\\nstrategy. In \\ufb01scal 2020 and \\ufb01scal 2021, Applied conducted surveys focused on employee engagement and\\nproductivity and on the future of work. Applied continues to support workplace \\ufb02exibility such as remote working\\nwhere possible, and follow enhanced safety and health protocols\\u2014including screenings, social distancing, and use\\nof personal protective equipment. In \\ufb01scal 2022, the focus of the employee survey was on engagement and\\nidentifying actionable insights to enable a segmented talent strategy to address engagement and retention in\\ntargeted employee populations (e.g., early tenure employees). 12 Table of Contents\\nAdditional information regarding Applied\\u2019s activities related to its people and sustainability, as well as its\\nworkforce diversity data, can be found in Applied\\u2019s latest Sustainability Report and Annex thereto, which are\\nlocated on its website at https://www.appliedmaterials.com/us/en/corporate-responsibility.html.

Applied\\u2019s industries\\nhistorically have been cyclical, and are subject to volatility and sudden changes in customer requirements for new\\nmanufacturing capacity and advanced technology. These changes can a\\ufb00ect the timing and amounts of customer\\ninvestments in technology and manufacturing equipment and can have a signi\\ufb01cant impact on Applied\\u2019s net sales,\\noperating expenses, gross margins and net income. The amount and mix of capital equipment spending between\\ndi\\ufb00erent products and technologies can have a signi\\ufb01cant impact on Applied\\u2019s results of operations.\\nTo meet rapidly changing demand in the industries it serves, Applied must accurately forecast demand and\\ne\\ufb00ectively manage its resources and production capacity across its businesses, and may incur unexpected or\\nadditional costs to align its business operations. During periods of increasing demand for its products, Applied must\\nhave su\\ufb03cient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand; e\\ufb00ectively manage its supply\\nchain; attract, retain and motivate a su\\ufb03cient number of quali\\ufb01ed employees; and continue to control costs. During\\nperiods of decreasing demand, Applied must reduce costs and align its cost structure with prevailing market\\nconditions; e\\ufb00ectively manage its supply chain; and motivate and retain key employees. If Applied does not\\ne\\ufb00ectively manage these challenges during periods of changing demand, its business performance and results of\\noperations may be adversely impacted. Even with e\\ufb00ective allocation of resources and management of costs,\\nduring periods of decreasing demand, Applied\\u2019s gross margins, cash \\ufb02ows and earnings may be adversely\\nimpacted.\\nApplied is exposed to risks associated with an uncertain global economy.\\nUncertain or adverse economic and business conditions, including uncertainties and volatility in the \\ufb01nancial\\nmarkets, national debt, \\ufb01scal or monetary concerns, rising in\\ufb02ation and interest rates in various regions, and\\neconomic recession, could materially adversely impact Applied\\u2019s operating results. Markets for semiconductors and\\ndisplays depend largely on business and consumer spending and demand for electronic products. Uncertain or\\nadverse economic and business conditions could result in decreases in consumer spending and demand. Such\\ndecreases in spending and demand have in the past caused, and may in the future cause, our customers to push\\nout, cancel or refrain from purchasing our equipment or services, which could negatively impact demand for our\\nproducts and services, reduce our backlog, increase our inventory, and materially adversely impact our operating\\nresults.\\nSimilarly, changes that result in sudden increases in consumer demand for electronic products have resulted\\nin, and may continue to result in, a shortage of parts and materials needed to manufacture our products. Such\\nshortages, as well as shipment delays due to transportation capacity and interruptions, have adversely impacted,\\nand may continue to adversely impact, our suppliers\\u2019 ability to meet our demand requirements. Accelerated digital\\ntransformation may further increase consumer demand and exacerbate such shortages and also strain our\\nmanufacturing capacity, which may adversely impact our ability to meet customer demands and thus have an\\nadverse impact on our revenues, results of operations and \\ufb01nancial condition.\\nUncertain or adverse economic and market conditions, di\\ufb03culties in obtaining capital, increased costs or\\nreduced pro\\ufb01tability may also cause some customers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other\\nmanufacturers, or \\ufb01le for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations, which can also result in lower\\nsales, additional inventory or bad debt expense for Applied. Economic and industry uncertainty may similarly a\\ufb00ect\\nsuppliers, which could impair their ability to deliver parts and negatively a\\ufb00ect Applied\\u2019s ability to manage\\noperations and deliver its products. These conditions may also lead to consolidation or strategic alliances among\\nother equipment manufacturers, which could adversely a\\ufb00ect Applied\\u2019s ability to compete e\\ufb00ectively.\\n16 Table of Contents\\nUncertain economic and industry conditions and continued supply chain disruptions also make it more\\nchallenging for Applied to forecast its operating results, make business decisions, and identify and prioritize the\\nrisks that may a\\ufb00ect its businesses, sources and uses of cash, \\ufb01nancial condition and results of operations. If\\nApplied does not appropriately manage its business operations in response to changing economic and industry\\nconditions, it could have a signi\\ufb01cant negative impact on its business performance and \\ufb01nancial condition. Applied\\nmay be required to implement additional cost reduction e\\ufb00orts, including restructuring activities, which may\\nadversely a\\ufb00ect Applied\\u2019s ability to capitalize on opportunities. Even during periods of economic uncertainty or\\nlower revenues, Applied must continue to invest in research and development and maintain a global business\\ninfrastructure to compete e\\ufb00ectively and support its customers, which can have a negative impact on its operating\\nmargins and earnings.\\nApplied maintains an investment portfolio that is subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate\\nrisks. The risks to Applied\\u2019s investment portfolio may be exacerbated if \\ufb01nancial market conditions deteriorate due\\nto rising in\\ufb02ation, rising interest rates, economic recession or impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and, as a result,\\nthe value and liquidity of the investment portfolio, as well as returns on pension assets, could be negatively\\nimpacted and lead to impairment charges. Applied also maintains cash balances in various bank accounts globally\\nin order to fund normal operations.

We also purchase a signi\\ufb01cant portion of equipment and supplies from suppliers outside\\nof the United States. There is inherent risk, based on the complex relationships among the United States and the\\ncountries in which we conduct our business, that political, diplomatic, and national security factors can lead to\\nglobal trade issues and changes in trade policies and export regulations, in particular, with respect to those\\na\\ufb00ecting the semiconductor industry. The United States and other countries have imposed and may continue to\\nimpose new trade restrictions and export regulations, and have also levied tari\\ufb00s and taxes on certain goods. Trade\\nrestrictions and export regulations, or increases in tari\\ufb00s and additional taxes, including any retaliatory measures,\\ncan negatively impact end-user demand and customer investment in manufacturing equipment, increase our\\nmanufacturing costs, decrease margins, reduce the competitiveness of our products, or prohibit our ability to sell\\nproducts, provide services or purchase necessary equipment and supplies, any or all of which could have a material\\nadverse e\\ufb00ect on our business, results of operations, or \\ufb01nancial condition.\\nFor example, certain international sales depend on our ability to obtain export licenses, and our inability to\\nobtain such licenses has limited and could further limit our markets and negatively impact our business. The U.S.\\ngovernment recently announced new export regulations for U.S. semiconductor technology sold in China, including\\nwafer fabrication equipment and related parts and services, which have limited the market for certain of our\\nproducts, adversely impacted our revenues, and increased our exposure to foreign competition. The U.S.\\nDepartment of Commerce has promulgated rules and regulations expanding export license requirements for U.S.\\ncompanies that sell certain products to entities in China whose actions or functions are intended to support military\\nend uses, eliminated certain export license exceptions that applied to exports of certain items to China, added\\ncertain Chinese companies to its \\u201cEntity List\\u201d and \\u201cUnveri\\ufb01ed List,\\u201d making those companies subject to additional\\nlicensing requirements, and expanded licensing requirements for exports to China of items for use in the\\ndevelopment or production of integrated circuits and certain technologies. These rules and regulations require us to\\nobtain additional export licenses to supply certain of our products or provide services to certain customers in China.\\nObtaining export licenses may be di\\ufb03cult, costly and time-consuming, and there is no assurance that we will be\\nissued licenses that we apply for on a timely basis or at all. Our inability to obtain such licenses could limit our\\nmarkets in China, may cause us to be displaced by foreign businesses and competitors and adversely a\\ufb00ect our\\nresults of operations. The implementation and interpretation of these rules and other regulatory actions taken by\\nthe U.S. government is uncertain and evolving, and may make it more challenging for Applied to manage its\\noperations and forecast its operating results. The U.S. and other governmental agencies may in the future\\npromulgate new or additional export licensing or other requirements that have the e\\ufb00ect of further limiting the\\nCompany\\u2019s ability to provide certain of its products and services to customers outside the U.S., including China.\\nThese and other regulatory changes that may occur in the future could materially and adversely a\\ufb00ect our\\nbusiness, results of operations or \\ufb01nancial condition. 18 Table of Contents\\nAs a global business with customers, suppliers and operations in many countries around the world, Applied\\nmay from time to time receive inquiries from government authorities about transactions between Applied and\\ncertain foreign entities. For example, in August 2022, Applied received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorney\\u2019s O\\ufb03ce\\nfor the District of Massachusetts requesting information relating to certain China customer shipments. We are\\ncooperating fully with the government. These inquiries are subject to uncertainties, and we cannot predict the\\noutcome of this inquiry, or any other governmental inquires or proceedings that may occur. Any violation or alleged\\nviolation of law or regulations could result in signi\\ufb01cant legal costs or in legal proceedings in which Applied or its\\nemployees could be subjected to \\ufb01nes and penalties and could result in restrictions on Applied\\u2019s business and\\ndamage to its reputation, and could have an adverse impact on its business operations, \\ufb01nancial condition and\\nresults of operations.\\nFurthermore, government authorities may take retaliatory actions, impose conditions that require the use of\\nlocal suppliers or partnerships with local companies, require the license or other transfer of intellectual property, or\\nengage in other e\\ufb00orts to promote local businesses and local competitors, which could have a signi\\ufb01cant adverse\\nimpact on Applied\\u2019s business. Many of these challenges are present in China and Korea, markets that represent a\\nsigni\\ufb01cant portion of Applied\\u2019s business.\\nApplied is exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base.\\nApplied\\u2019s customer base is highly concentrated and has become increasingly so as a result of continued\\nconsolidation. Applied\\u2019s customer base is also geographically concentrated, particularly in China, Taiwan and Korea.\\nA relatively limited number of manufacturers account for a substantial portion of Applied\\u2019s business. As a result, the\\nactions of even a single customer or export regulations that apply to customers in certain countries, such as those\\nin China, have exposed and can further expose Applied\\u2019s business and results of operations to greater volatility.\\nThe geographic concentration of Applied\\u2019s customer base could shift over time as a result of government policy and\\nincentives to develop regional semiconductor industries. The mix and type of customers, and sales to any single\\ncustomer, including as a result of changes in government policy, have varied and may vary signi\\ufb01cantly from\\nquarter to quarter and from year to year, and have had, and may continue to have, a signi\\ufb01cant impact on\\nApplied\\u2019s net sales, gross margins and net income. Applied\\u2019s products are con\\ufb01gured to customer speci\\ufb01cations,\\nand changing, rescheduling or canceling orders may result in signi\\ufb01cant, non-recoverable costs. If customers do not\\nplace orders, or they substantially reduce, delay or cancel orders (including as a result of uncertain or adverse\\neconomic conditions, our inability to ful\\ufb01ll orders due to export regulations, shortage of parts, transportation\\ncapacity/interruptions or any other reason), Applied may not be able to replace the business, which may have a\\nsigni\\ufb01cant adverse impact on its results of operations and \\ufb01nancial condition. The concentration of Applied\\u2019s\\ncustomer base increases its risks related to the \\ufb01nancial condition of its customers, and the deterioration in\\n\\ufb01nancial condition of a single customer or the failure of a single customer to perform its obligations could have a\\nmaterial adverse e\\ufb00ect on Applied\\u2019s results of operations and cash \\ufb02ow. To the extent its customers experience\\nliquidity constraints, Applied may incur bad debt expense, which may have a signi\\ufb01cant impact on its results of\\noperations. Major customers may also seek pricing, payment, intellectual property-related, or other commercial\\nterms that are less favorable to Applied, which may have a negative impact on Applied\\u2019s business, cash \\ufb02ow,\\nrevenue and gross margins.\\n19 Table of Contents\\nSupply chain disruptions, manufacturing interruptions or delays, or the failure to accurately forecast\\ncustomer demand, could a\\ufb00ect Applied\\u2019s ability to meet customer demand, lead to higher costs, or\\nresult in excess or obsolete inventory.\\nApplied\\u2019s business depends on its timely supply of equipment, services and related products to meet the\\nchanging technical and volume requirements of its customers, which depends in part on the timely delivery of\\nparts, materials and services, including components and subassemblies, from suppliers and contract\\nmanufacturers. Signi\\ufb01cant and sudden increases in demand for Applied\\u2019s products, as well as worldwide demand\\nfor electronic products, have resulted in, and may continue to result in, a shortage of parts, materials and services\\nneeded to manufacture Applied\\u2019s products. Such shortages, as well as delays in and unpredictability of shipments\\ndue to transportation interruptions, have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, our suppliers\\u2019\\nability to meet our demand requirements. Di\\ufb03culties in obtaining su\\ufb03cient and timely supply of parts, materials or\\nservices, and delays in and unpredictability of shipments due to transportation interruptions, have adversely\\nimpacted, and may continue to adversely impact, Applied\\u2019s manufacturing operations and its ability to meet\\ncustomer demand. Moreover, lockdowns that may from time to time be imposed in various geographic regions in\\nresponse to periodic spikes in COVID-19 cases and related travel and logistics restrictions may result in additional\\nsupply chain and transportation disruptions, production delays, capacity limitations and cost increases. Our\\noperating results may be adversely impacted if we are unable to obtain parts, materials or services needed to\\nmanufacture Applied\\u2019s products, or if we are unable to do so on a timely manner or on favorable terms. Ongoing\\nsupply chain constraints may continue to increase costs of logistics and parts for our products and may cause us to\\npass on increased costs to our customers. Such increase in costs may lead to reduced demand for our products and\\nmaterially adversely impact our operating results. Some key parts are subject to long lead-times or available only\\nfrom a single supplier or limited group of suppliers, and some sourcing or subassembly is provided by suppliers\\nlocated in countries other than the countries where Applied conducts its manufacturing. Supply chain disruptions\\nhave caused and may continue to cause delays in our equipment production and delivery schedules, which can\\nlead to our business performance becoming signi\\ufb01cantly dependent on quarter-end production and delivery\\nschedules, and could have an adverse impact on our operating and \\ufb01nancial results. Volatility of demand for\\nmanufacturing equipment can also increase capital, technical, operational and other risks for Applied and for\\ncompanies throughout its supply chain, and may cause some suppliers to exit businesses, or scale back or cease\\noperations, which could impact our ability to meet customer demand.\\nApplied may also experience signi\\ufb01cant interruptions of its manufacturing operations, delays in its ability to\\ndeliver or install products or services, increased costs, customer order cancellations or reduced demand for its\\nproducts as a result of:\\n\\u2022global trade issues and changes in and uncertainties with respect to trade and export regulations, trade\\npolicies and sanctions, tari\\ufb00s, and international trade disputes, including new and changing export\\nregulations for certain exports to China, where a signi\\ufb01cant portion of Applied\\u2019s supply chain is located, and\\nany retaliatory measures, that adversely impact Applied or its direct or sub-tier suppliers;\\n\\u2022the failure or inability to accurately forecast demand and obtain su\\ufb03cient quantities of quality parts on a\\ncost-e\\ufb00ective basis;\\n\\u2022volatility in the availability and cost of parts, commodities, energy and shipping related to our products,\\nincluding increased costs due to rising in\\ufb02ation or interest rates or other market conditions;\\n\\u2022di\\ufb03culties or delays in obtaining required import or export licenses and approvals;\\n\\u2022shipment delays due to transportation interruptions or capacity constraints;\\n\\u2022a worldwide shortage of semiconductor components as a result of sharp increases in demand for\\nsemiconductor products in general;\\n\\u2022information technology or infrastructure failures, including those of a third party supplier or service\\nprovider; and\\n\\u2022natural disasters, the impacts of climate change, or other events beyond Applied\\u2019s control (such as\\nearthquakes, utility interruptions, tsunamis, hurricanes, typhoons, \\ufb02oods, storms or extreme weather\\nconditions, \\ufb01res, regional economic downturns, regional or global health epidemics, including the COVID-19\\npandemic, geopolitical turmoil, increased trade restrictions between the U.S. and China and other countries,\\nsocial unrest, political instability, terrorism, or acts of war) in locations where it or its customers or suppliers\\nhave manufacturing, research, engineering or other operations.\\nIf a supplier fails to meet Applied\\u2019s requirements concerning quality, cost, intellectual property protection,\\nsocially-responsible business practices, or other performance factors, Applied may transfer its business to\\nalternative sources. Transferring business to alternative suppliers could result in manufacturing delays, additional\\ncosts or other di\\ufb03culties, and may impair Applied\\u2019s ability to protect, enforce and extract the full value of its\\nintellectual property rights, as well as the intellectual property rights of its customers\\u2019 and other third parties.\\nThese outcomes could have an adverse impact on its business and competitive position and subject Applied to\\nlegal proceedings and claims. In addition, if Applied is unable to meet its customers\\u2019 demand for a prolonged period\\ndue to its inability to obtain certain parts or components from suppliers on a timely basis or at all, its business,\\nresults of operations and customer relationships could be adversely impacted. 20 Table of Contents\\nIn addition, if Applied needs to rapidly increase its business and manufacturing capacity to meet increases in\\ndemand or expedited shipment schedules, this may strain Applied\\u2019s manufacturing and supply chain operations,\\nand negatively impact Applied\\u2019s working capital. Moreover, if actual demand for Applied\\u2019s products is di\\ufb00erent than\\nexpected, Applied may purchase more or fewer parts than necessary or incur costs for canceling, postponing or\\nexpediting delivery of parts. If Applied purchases or commits to purchase inventory in anticipation of customer\\ndemand that does not materialize, or such inventory is rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of technological\\nchange, or if customers reduce, delay or cancel orders, Applied may incur excess or obsolete inventory charges.\\nThe continued e\\ufb00ects of the COVID-19 pandemic and global measures taken in response have\\nadversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, Applied\\u2019s operations and \\ufb01nancial results.\\nThe continued e\\ufb00ects of the COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken in response by governments and\\nbusinesses worldwide to contain its spread have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact\\nApplied\\u2019s supply chain, manufacturing, logistics, workforce and operations, as well as the operations of Applied\\u2019s\\ncustomers, suppliers and partners globally. There is continued uncertainty regarding the duration, scope and\\nseverity of the pandemic, particularly with the emergence of new variants of COVID-19 and periodic spikes in\\nCOVID-19 cases in various geographic regions, and the impacts on our business and the global economy from the\\ne\\ufb00ects of the pandemic and response measures. Travel and logistics restrictions, lockdowns, vaccine requirements\\nand other measures from time to time implemented by foreign and domestic authorities have resulted in, and may\\ncontinue to result in, supply chain and transportation disruptions, production delays and capacity limitations at\\nApplied and some of its customers, suppliers and partners, as well as reduced workforce availability or productivity\\nat Applied and customer sites, and additional data, information and cyber security risks associated with an\\nextensive workforce working remotely.\\nAs economic activity and business operations in certain regions recover, there have been and may continue to\\nbe periods of signi\\ufb01cant or sudden increases in demand for Applied\\u2019s products, as well as worldwide demand for\\nelectronic products. Signi\\ufb01cant or sudden demand increases have resulted in, and may continue to result in, a\\nshortage of parts, materials or services needed to manufacture Applied\\u2019s products. We have also experienced, and\\nmay continue to experience, shipment delays due to transportation interruptions or capacity constraints. Such\\nshortages or delays have adversely impacted, and could continue to adversely impact, our suppliers\\u2019 ability to\\nmeet our demand requirements and do so on favorable terms, and our ability to meet our customer demand. There\\ncan be no assurance that Applied or its suppliers will be able to maintain manufacturing operations at levels\\nnecessary to adequately address demand for Applied products. In addition, the pandemic and measures taken in\\nresponse thereto have had, and may continue to have, a signi\\ufb01cant adverse impact on the global economic activity\\nand could also result in a reduced demand for our products, delayed deliveries or installation, cancelled orders or\\nincrease in logistics and operating costs, and materially and adversely a\\ufb00ect Applied\\u2019s business, \\ufb01nancial condition\\nand results of operations.\\nThe degree to which the pandemic ultimately impacts Applied\\u2019s business, \\ufb01nancial condition and results of\\noperations and the global economy will depend on future developments beyond our control, which are highly\\nuncertain and di\\ufb03cult to predict, including the severity, duration and any resurgence of the pandemic, the extent,\\nduration and e\\ufb00ectiveness of periodic lockdowns and other containment actions, the availability, public adoption\\nand e\\ufb03cacy of COVID vaccines, how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating activity can\\nresume, and the severity and duration of resulting global economic volatility.\\nApplied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes in the various industries in which it\\noperates.\\nThe global semiconductor, display and related industries in which Applied operates are characterized by\\nongoing changes a\\ufb00ecting some or all of these industries that impact demand for and the pro\\ufb01tability of Applied\\u2019s\\nproducts and its consolidated results of operations, including:\\n\\u2022the nature, timing and degree of visibility of changes in end demand for electronic products, including those\\nrelated to \\ufb02uctuations in consumer buying patterns tied to general economic conditions, seasonality or the\\nintroduction of new products, and the e\\ufb00ects of these changes on customers\\u2019 businesses and on demand for\\nApplied\\u2019s products;\\n\\u2022increasing capital requirements for building and operating new fabrication plants and customers\\u2019 ability to\\nraise the necessary capital;\\n\\u2022trade, regulatory, tax or government incentive policies impacting the timing of customers\\u2019 investment in\\nnew or expanded fabrication plants;\\n\\u2022di\\ufb00erences in growth rates among the semiconductor, display and other industries in which Applied\\noperates;\\n\\u2022the increasing importance of establishing, improving and maintaining strong relationships with customers;\\n\\u2022the increasing cost and complexity for customers to move from product design to volume manufacturing,\\nwhich may slow the adoption rate of new manufacturing technology;\\n\\u2022the need for customers to continually reduce the total cost of manufacturing system ownership; 21 Table of Contents\\n\\u2022the heightened importance to customers of system reliability and productivity and the e\\ufb00ect on demand for\\nfabrication systems as a result of their increasing productivity, device yield and reliability;\\n\\u2022manufacturers\\u2019 ability to recon\\ufb01gure and re-use fabrication systems which can reduce demand for new\\nequipment;\\n\\u2022the increasing importance of, and di\\ufb03culties in, developing products with su\\ufb03cient di\\ufb00erentiation to\\nin\\ufb02uence customers\\u2019 purchasing decisions;\\n\\u2022requirements for shorter cycle times for the development, manufacture and installation of manufacturing\\nequipment;\\n\\u2022price and performance trends for semiconductor devices and displays, and the corresponding e\\ufb00ect on\\ndemand for such products;\\n\\u2022the increasing importance of the availability of spare parts to maximize the time that customers\\u2019 systems\\nare available for production;\\n\\u2022increasing government incentives for local suppliers;\\n\\u2022the increasing role for and complexity of software in Applied products;\\u00a0and\\n\\u2022the increasing focus on reducing energy usage and improving the environmental impact and sustainability\\nassociated with manufacturing operations.\\nApplied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes speci\\ufb01c to the semiconductor industry.\\nThe largest proportion of Applied\\u2019s consolidated net sales and pro\\ufb01tability is derived from sales of\\nmanufacturing equipment in the Semiconductor Systems segment to the global semiconductor industry.

To compete\\nsuccessfully, Applied must:\\n\\u2022identify and address technology in\\ufb02ections, market changes, competitor innovations, new applications,\\ncustomer requirements and end-use demand in a timely and e\\ufb00ective manner;\\n\\u2022develop new products and disruptive technologies, improve and develop new applications for existing\\nproducts, and adapt products for use by customers in di\\ufb00erent applications and markets with varying\\ntechnical requirements;\\n\\u2022di\\ufb00erentiate its products from those of competitors, meet customers\\u2019 performance speci\\ufb01cations (including\\nthose related to energy consumption and environmental impact more broadly), appropriately price products,\\nand achieve market acceptance; 23 Table of Contents\\n\\u2022maintain operating \\ufb02exibility to enable responses to changing markets, applications, customers and\\ncustomer requirements;\\n\\u2022enhance its worldwide operations across its businesses to reduce cycle time, enable continuous quality\\nimprovement, reduce costs, and enhance design for manufacturability and serviceability;\\n\\u2022focus on product development and sales and marketing strategies that address customers\\u2019 high value\\nproblems and strengthen customer relationships;\\n\\u2022e\\ufb00ectively allocate resources between its existing products and markets, the development of new products,\\nand expanding into new and adjacent markets;\\n\\u2022improve the productivity of capital invested in R&D activities;\\n\\u2022accurately forecast demand, work with suppliers and meet production schedules for its products;\\n\\u2022improve its manufacturing processes and achieve cost e\\ufb03ciencies across product o\\ufb00erings;\\n\\u2022adapt to changes in value o\\ufb00ered by companies in di\\ufb00erent parts of the supply chain;\\n\\u2022qualify products for evaluation and volume manufacturing with its customers; and\\n\\u2022implement changes in its design engineering methodology to reduce material costs and cycle time,\\nincrease commonality of platforms and types of parts used in di\\ufb00erent systems, and improve product life\\ncycle management.\\nIf Applied does not successfully anticipate technology in\\ufb02ections, develop and commercialize new products and\\ntechnologies, and respond to changes in customer requirements and market trends, its business performance and\\nresults of operations may be adversely impacted.\\nApplied is exposed to risks associated with expanding into new and related markets and industries.\\nAs part of its growth strategy, Applied seeks to expand into related or new markets and industries, either with\\nits existing products or with new products developed internally, or those developed in collaboration with third\\nparties, or obtained through acquisitions. Applied\\u2019s ability to successfully expand its business into new and related\\nmarkets and industries may be adversely a\\ufb00ected by a number of factors, including:\\n\\u2022the need to devote additional resources to develop new products for, and operate in, new markets;\\n\\u2022the need to develop new sales and technical marketing strategies, cultivate relationships with new\\ncustomers and meet di\\ufb00erent customer service requirements;\\n\\u2022di\\ufb00ering rates of pro\\ufb01tability and growth among multiple businesses;\\n\\u2022Applied\\u2019s ability to anticipate demand, capitalize on opportunities, and avoid or minimize risks;\\n\\u2022the complexity of managing multiple businesses with variations in production planning, execution, supply\\nchain management and logistics;\\n\\u2022the adoption of new business models, business processes and systems;\\n\\u2022the complexity of entering into and e\\ufb00ectively managing strategic alliances or partnering opportunities;\\n\\u2022new materials, processes and technologies;\\n\\u2022the need to attract, motivate and retain employees with skills and expertise in these new areas;\\n\\u2022new and more diverse customers and suppliers, including some with limited operating histories, uncertain\\nor limited funding, evolving business models or locations in regions where Applied does not have, or has\\nlimited, operations;\\n\\u2022new or di\\ufb00erent competitors with potentially more \\ufb01nancial or other resources, industry experience and\\nestablished customer relationships;\\n\\u2022entry into new industries and countries, with di\\ufb00ering levels of government involvement, laws and\\nregulations, and business, employment and safety practices and requirements;\\n\\u2022third parties\\u2019 intellectual property rights;\\u00a0and\\n\\u2022the need to comply with, or work to establish, industry standards and practices.\\nIn addition, Applied from time to time receives funding from United States and other government agencies for\\ncertain strategic development programs to increase its research and development resources and address new\\nmarket opportunities. As a condition to this government funding, Applied is often subject to certain record-keeping,\\naudit, intellectual property rights-sharing, and/or other obligations.\\n24 Table of Contents\\nOperational and Financial Risks\\nApplied is exposed to various risks related to protection and enforcement of intellectual property\\nrights.\\nApplied\\u2019s success depends in signi\\ufb01cant part on the protection of its technology using patents, trade secrets,\\ncopyrights and other intellectual property rights. Infringement or misappropriation of Applied\\u2019s intellectual property\\nrights, such as the unauthorized manufacture or sale of equipment or spare parts, could result in uncompensated\\nlost market and revenue opportunities for Applied. Monitoring and detecting any unauthorized use of intellectual\\nproperty is di\\ufb03cult and costly and Applied cannot be certain that the protective measures it has implemented will\\ncompletely prevent misuse. Applied\\u2019s ability to enforce its intellectual property rights is subject to litigation risks, as\\nwell as uncertainty as to the protection and enforceability of those rights in some countries. If Applied seeks to\\nenforce its intellectual property rights, it may be subject to claims that those rights are invalid or unenforceable,\\nand others may seek counterclaims against Applied, which could have a negative impact on its business. If Applied\\nis unable to enforce and protect intellectual property rights, or if they are circumvented, rendered obsolete or\\ninvalidated by the rapid pace of technological change, or stolen or misappropriated by employees or third parties, it\\ncould have an adverse impact on its competitive position and business. In addition, changes in intellectual property\\nlaws or their interpretation may impact Applied\\u2019s ability to protect and assert its intellectual property rights,\\nincrease costs and uncertainties in the prosecution of patent applications or related enforcement actions, and\\ndiminish the value and competitive advantage conferred by Applied\\u2019s intellectual property assets.\\nThird parties may also assert claims against Applied and its products. Claims that Applied\\u2019s products infringe\\nthe rights of others, whether or not meritorious, can be expensive and time-consuming to defend and resolve, and\\nmay divert the e\\ufb00orts and attention of management and personnel. The inability to obtain rights to use third party\\nintellectual property on commercially reasonable terms could have an adverse impact on Applied\\u2019s business. In\\naddition, Applied may face claims based on the theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of third-party trade secrets\\nand other con\\ufb01dential business information. Any such incidents and claims could severely harm Applied\\u2019s business\\nand reputation, result in signi\\ufb01cant expenses, harm its competitive position, and prevent Applied from selling\\ncertain products, all of which could have a signi\\ufb01cant adverse impact on Applied\\u2019s business and results of\\noperations.\\nApplied is exposed to risks related to cybersecurity threats and incidents.\\nIn the conduct of its business, Applied collects, uses, transmits and stores data on information technology\\nsystems, including systems owned and maintained by Applied or its third-party providers. These data include\\ncon\\ufb01dential information and intellectual property belonging to Applied or its customers or other business partners,\\nas well as personal information of individuals. All information technology systems are subject to disruption, breach\\nor failure. Applied and its third-party providers have experienced, and expect to continue to experience,\\ncybersecurity incidents, some of which have been, and may continue to be, successful. These cybersecurity\\nincidents may range from employee error or misuse or unauthorized use of information technology systems or\\ncon\\ufb01dential information, to individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to these information systems, to\\nsophisticated cybersecurity attacks, known as advanced persistent threats, any of which may target the Company\\ndirectly or indirectly through its third party providers and global supply chain. Globally, cybersecurity attacks are\\nincreasing in number and the attackers are increasingly organized and well-\\ufb01nanced, or at times supported by\\nstate actors. In addition, geopolitical tensions or con\\ufb02icts, such as Russia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine or increasing tension\\nwith China, may create a heightened risk of cybersecurity attacks. Although no such cybersecurity incident has\\nbeen material to the Company to date, Applied continues to devote signi\\ufb01cant resources to network security, data\\nencryption, and other measures to protect its systems and data from unauthorized access or misuse, and it may be\\nrequired to expend greater resources in the future, especially in the face of continuously evolving and increasingly\\nsophisticated cybersecurity threats and privacy and data protection laws. Applied may be unable to anticipate,\\nprevent or remediate future attacks, and in some instances Applied may be unaware of a cybersecurity incident or\\nits magnitude and e\\ufb00ects, particularly as attackers are becoming increasingly able to circumvent controls and\\nremove forensic evidence. Depending on their nature and scope, cybersecurity incidents may result in business\\ndisruption, such as delay in the development and delivery of Applied\\u2019s products or disruption of Applied\\u2019s\\nmanufacturing processes, internal communications, interactions with customers and suppliers and processing and\\nreporting \\ufb01nancial results; the theft or misappropriation of intellectual property; corruption, loss of, or inability to\\naccess (e.g., through ransomware or denial of service) con\\ufb01dential information and critical data (i.e., that of\\nApplied and its third party providers and customers); reputational damage; litigation or regulatory enforcement\\naction related to contractual or regulatory privacy, cybersecurity, data protection, or other con\\ufb01dentiality\\nobligations; diminution in the value of Applied\\u2019s investment in research, development and engineering; and\\nincreased costs associated with the implementation of cybersecurity measures to detect, deter, protect against,\\nand recover from such incidents. Compliance with, and changes to, laws and regulations concerning privacy,\\ncybersecurity, and data protection, including developing restrictions on cross-border data transfer, could result in\\nsigni\\ufb01cant expense, and any failure to comply could result in proceedings against Applied by regulatory authorities\\nor other third parties. Further, customers and third-party providers increasingly demand rigorous contractual\\nprovisions regarding privacy, cybersecurity, data protection, con\\ufb01dentiality, and intellectual property, which may\\nalso increase our overall compliance burden. 25 Table of Contents\\nApplied is exposed to risks associated with business combinations, acquisitions, strategic\\ninvestments and divestitures.\\nApplied engages in acquisitions of or investments in companies, technologies or products in existing, related or\\nnew markets for Applied. Business combinations, acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks to Applied\\u2019s\\nbusiness, \\ufb01nancial condition and operating results, including but not limited to:\\n\\u2022inability to complete proposed transactions timely or at all due to the failure to obtain regulatory or other\\napprovals, litigation or other disputes, and any ensuing obligation to pay a termination fee;\\n\\u2022diversion of management\\u2019s attention and disruption of ongoing businesses;\\n\\u2022the failure to realize expected revenues, gross and operating margins, net income and other returns from\\nacquired businesses;\\n\\u2022requirements imposed by government regulators in connection with their review of a transaction, which\\nmay include, among other things, divestitures and restrictions on the conduct of Applied\\u2019s existing business\\nor the acquired business;\\n\\u2022following completion of acquisitions, ine\\ufb00ective integration of businesses, operations, systems, digital and\\nphysical security, technologies, products, employees, compliance programs, changes in laws or regulations,\\nincluding tax laws, or other factors, may impact the ability to realize anticipated synergies or other bene\\ufb01ts;\\n\\u2022failure to commercialize technologies from acquired businesses or developed through strategic\\ninvestments;\\n\\u2022dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners;\\n\\u2022inability to capitalize on characteristics of new markets that may be signi\\ufb01cantly di\\ufb00erent from Applied\\u2019s\\nexisting markets and where competitors may have stronger market positions and customer relationships;\\n\\u2022failure to retain and motivate key employees of acquired businesses;\\n\\u2022the potential impact of the announcement or consummation of a proposed transaction on relationships with\\nthird parties;\\n\\u2022potential changes in Applied\\u2019s credit rating, which could adversely impact the Company\\u2019s access to and\\ncost of capital;\\n\\u2022reductions in cash balances or increases in debt obligations to \\ufb01nance activities associated with a\\ntransaction, which increase interest expense, and reductions in cash balances, which reduce the availability\\nof cash \\ufb02ow for general corporate or other purposes, including share repurchases and dividends;\\n\\u2022exposure to new operational risks, rules, regulations, worker expectations, customs and practices to the\\nextent acquired businesses are located in regions where Applied has not historically conducted business;\\n\\u2022challenges associated with managing new, more diverse and more widespread operations, projects and\\npeople;\\n\\u2022inability to obtain and protect intellectual property rights in key technologies;\\n\\u2022inadequacy or ine\\ufb00ectiveness of an acquired company\\u2019s internal \\ufb01nancial controls, disclosure controls and\\nprocedures, cybersecurity, privacy policies and compliance programs, or environmental, health and safety,\\nanti-corruption, human resource, or other policies or practices;\\n\\u2022impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill as a result of changing business conditions,\\ntechnological advancements or worse-than-expected performance of the segment;\\n\\u2022the risk of litigation or claims associated with a proposed or completed transaction;\\n\\u2022unknown, underestimated, undisclosed or undetected commitments or liabilities or non-compliance with\\nlaws, regulations or policies; and\\n\\u2022the inappropriate scale of acquired entities\\u2019 critical resources or facilities for business needs.\\nApplied also makes investments in other companies, including companies formed as joint ventures, which may\\ndecline in value or not meet desired objectives. The success of these investments depends on various factors over\\nwhich Applied may have limited or no control and, particularly with respect to joint ventures, requires ongoing and\\ne\\ufb00ective cooperation with partners. In addition, new legislation, additional regulations or global economic or\\npolitical conditions may a\\ufb00ect or impair our ability to invest in certain countries or require us to obtain regulatory\\napprovals to do so. Applied may not receive the necessary regulatory approvals or the approvals may come with\\nsigni\\ufb01cant conditions or obligations. The risks to Applied\\u2019s investment portfolio may be exacerbated by unfavorable\\n\\ufb01nancial market and macroeconomic conditions and, as a result, the value of the investment portfolio could be\\nnegatively impacted and lead to impairment charges.\\n26 Table of Contents\\nApplied continually assesses the strategic \\ufb01t of its businesses and may from time to time seek to divest\\nportions of its business that are not deemed to \\ufb01t with its strategic plan. Some divestitures may take the form of\\nApplied contributing assets to a joint venture, and thus are subject to the joint venture risks discussed above. In\\naddition, divestitures involve signi\\ufb01cant risks and uncertainties, such as ability to sell such businesses on\\nsatisfactory price and terms and in a timely manner (including long and costly sales processes and the possibility of\\nlengthy and potentially unsuccessful attempts by a buyer to receive required regulatory approvals), or at all,\\ndisruption to other parts of the businesses and distraction of management, allocation of internal resources that\\nwould otherwise be devoted to completing strategic acquisitions, loss of key employees or customers, exposure to\\nunanticipated liabilities (including, among other things, those arising from representations and warranties made to\\na buyer regarding the businesses) or ongoing obligations to support the businesses following such divestitures, and\\nother adverse \\ufb01nancial impacts.\\nThe ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees is vital to Applied\\u2019s success.\\nApplied\\u2019s success, competitiveness and ability to execute on its global strategies and maintain a culture of\\ninnovation depend in large part on its ability to attract, retain and motivate quali\\ufb01ed employees and leaders with\\nthe necessary expertise and capabilities, representing diverse backgrounds and experiences. Achieving this\\nobjective may be di\\ufb03cult due to many factors, including \\ufb02uctuations in global economic and industry conditions,\\nmanagement or organizational changes, increasing competition for talent, the availability of quali\\ufb01ed employees in\\nthe markets, availability of career development opportunities, the ability to obtain necessary authorizations for\\nworkers to provide services outside their home countries, and the attractiveness of Applied\\u2019s compensation and\\nbene\\ufb01t programs, including its share-based programs, and Applied\\u2019s employment policies, including the \\ufb02exibility\\nof its remote-work arrangements. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, increasing costs to\\nattract and retain needed talent, driven by macro-economic conditions and a highly competitive labor market. If we\\nare unable to attract, retain and motivate quali\\ufb01ed employees and leaders, we may be unable to fully capitalize on\\ncurrent and new market opportunities, which could adversely impact Applied\\u2019s business and results of operations.\\nThe loss or retirement of employees presents particular challenges to the extent they involve the departure of\\nknowledgeable and experienced employees and the resulting need to identify and train existing or new candidates\\nto perform necessary functions, which may result in unexpected costs, reduced productivity, and/or di\\ufb03culties with\\nrespect to internal processes and controls.\\nApplied is exposed to risks associated with operating in jurisdictions with complex and changing tax\\nlaws.\\nApplied is subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. Signi\\ufb01cant judgment is\\nrequired to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities. Applied\\u2019s provision for income taxes and e\\ufb00ective tax\\nrates could be a\\ufb00ected by numerous factors, including changes in applicable tax laws, interpretations of applicable\\ntax laws, amount and composition of pre-tax income in jurisdictions with di\\ufb00ering tax rates, and valuation of\\ndeferred tax assets.\\nBeginning in \\ufb01scal 2023, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017 eliminates the option to\\ndeduct research and development expenditures currently and requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize them\\nover \\ufb01ve or \\ufb01fteen years. Although Congress is considering legislation that would defer the capitalization and\\namortization requirement, there is no assurance that the provision will be repealed or otherwise modi\\ufb01ed. If the\\nrequirement is not modi\\ufb01ed, it may increase Applied\\u2019s provision for income taxes and e\\ufb00ective tax rates beginning\\nin \\ufb01scal 2023.\\nOn August 16, 2022, the U.S. government enacted the In\\ufb02ation Reduction Act, which introduces a new 15%\\ncorporate minimum tax and includes an excise tax that would impose a 1% surcharge on stock repurchases, and\\nwhich may impact Applied\\u2019s \\ufb01nancial results beginning in \\ufb01scal 2024 and 2023, respectively.\\nThere have been a number of proposed changes in the tax laws that, if enacted, would increase our tax\\nliability. While it is too early to predict the outcome of these proposals, if enacted, they could have a material\\nimpact on our provision for income taxes and e\\ufb00ective tax rate. An increase in Applied\\u2019s provision for income taxes\\nand e\\ufb00ective tax rate could, in turn, have a material adverse impact on Applied\\u2019s results of operations and \\ufb01nancial\\ncondition.\\nConsistent with the international nature of its business, Applied conducts certain manufacturing, supply chain,\\nand other operations in Asia, bringing these activities closer to customers and reducing operating costs. In certain\\nforeign jurisdictions, conditional reduced income tax rates have been granted to Applied. To obtain the bene\\ufb01t of\\nthese tax incentives, Applied must meet requirements relating to various activities. Applied\\u2019s ability to realize\\nbene\\ufb01ts from these incentives could be materially a\\ufb00ected if, among other things, applicable requirements are not\\nmet or Applied incurs net losses in these jurisdictions.\\nIn addition, Applied is subject to examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities,\\nand from time to time amends previously \\ufb01led tax returns. Applied regularly assesses the likelihood of favorable or\\nunfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations and amendments to determine the adequacy of its\\nprovision for income taxes, which requires estimates and judgments. Although Applied believes its tax estimates\\nare reasonable, there can be no assurance that the tax authorities will agree with such estimates. Applied may\\nhave to engage in litigation to achieve the results re\\ufb02ected in the estimates, which may be time-consuming and\\nexpensive. There can be no assurance that Applied will be successful or that any \\ufb01nal determination will not be materially di\\ufb00erent from the treatment re\\ufb02ected in Applied\\u2019s historical income tax provisions and e\\ufb00ective tax\\nrates.\\n27 Table of Contents\\nApplied\\u2019s indebtedness and debt covenants could adversely a\\ufb00ect its \\ufb01nancial condition and\\nbusiness.\\nApplied has $5.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding. Under the\\nindenture governing the senior unsecured notes, it may be required to o\\ufb00er to repurchase the notes at a price\\nequal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, upon a change of control of Applied and a\\ncontemporaneous downgrade of the notes below investment grade. Applied also has in place a $1.5 billion\\nrevolving credit facility. While no amounts were outstanding under this credit facility as of October\\u00a030, 2022,\\nApplied may borrow amounts in the future under this credit facility. Applied may also enter into new \\ufb01nancing\\narrangements. Applied\\u2019s ability to satisfy its debt obligations is dependent upon the results of its business\\noperations and subject to other risks discussed in this section. Signi\\ufb01cant changes in Applied\\u2019s credit rating,\\ndisruptions in the global \\ufb01nancial markets or changes in the interest rate environment could have a material\\nadverse consequence on Applied\\u2019s access to and cost of capital for future \\ufb01nancings, and \\ufb01nancial condition. If\\nApplied fails to satisfy its debt obligations, or comply with \\ufb01nancial and other debt covenants, it may be in default\\nand any borrowings may become immediately due and payable, and such default may also constitute a default\\nunder other of Applied\\u2019s obligations. There can be no assurance that Applied would have su\\ufb03cient \\ufb01nancial\\nresources or be able to arrange \\ufb01nancing to repay any borrowings at such time.\\nThe failure to successfully implement enterprise resource planning and other information systems\\nchanges could adversely impact Applied\\u2019s business and results of operations.\\nApplied periodically implements new or enhanced enterprise resource planning and related information\\nsystems in order to better manage its business operations, align its global organizations and enable future growth.\\nImplementation of new business processes and information systems requires the commitment of signi\\ufb01cant\\npersonnel, training and \\ufb01nancial resources, and entails risks to Applied\\u2019s business operations. If Applied does not\\nsuccessfully implement enterprise resource planning and related information systems improvements, or if there are\\ndelays or di\\ufb03culties in implementing these systems, Applied may not realize anticipated productivity\\nimprovements or cost e\\ufb03ciencies, and may experience interruptions in service and operational di\\ufb03culties, such as\\nits ability to track orders, timely manufacture and ship products, project inventory requirements, e\\ufb00ectively\\nmanage its supply chain and allocate human resources, aggregate \\ufb01nancial data and report operating results, and\\notherwise e\\ufb00ectively manage its business, all of which could result in quality issues, reputational harm, lost market\\nand revenue opportunities, and otherwise adversely a\\ufb00ect Applied\\u2019s business, \\ufb01nancial condition and results of\\noperations.\\nApplied may incur impairment charges related to goodwill or long-lived assets.\\nApplied has a signi\\ufb01cant amount of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets related to acquisitions.\\nGoodwill and purchased intangible assets with inde\\ufb01nite useful lives are not amortized, but are reviewed for\\nimpairment annually during the fourth quarter of each \\ufb01scal year, and more frequently when events or changes in\\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. The review compares the fair\\nvalue for each of Applied\\u2019s reporting units to its associated carrying value, including goodwill. Factors that could\\nlead to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets include adverse industry or economic trends, reduced\\nestimates of future cash \\ufb02ows, declines in the market price of Applied common stock, changes in Applied\\u2019s\\nstrategies or product portfolio, and restructuring activities. Applied\\u2019s valuation methodology for assessing\\nimpairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and\\nprojections of future operating performance. Applied may be required to record future charges to earnings during\\nthe period in which an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets is determined to exist.\\nLegal, Compliance, and Other Risks\\nApplied is exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings, claims and investigations.\\nApplied from time to time is, and in the future may be involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent\\ninfringement, trade secret misappropriation, and other intellectual property rights, trade, including import, export\\nand customs, antitrust, environmental regulations, privacy, data protection, securities, contracts, product\\nperformance, product liability, unfair competition, employment, workplace safety, and other matters. Applied also\\nmay receive, and has received, inquiries, warrants, subpoenas, and other requests for information in connection\\nwith government investigations of potential or suspected violations of law or regulations by Applied and/or its\\nemployees. Applied also on occasion receives noti\\ufb01cation from customers who believe that Applied owes them\\nindemni\\ufb01cation, product warranty or has other obligations related to claims made against such customers by third\\nparties.\\nLegal proceedings, claims, and government investigations, whether with or without merit, and internal\\ninvestigations, may\\u00a0be time-consuming and expensive to prosecute, defend or conduct; divert management\\u2019s\\nattention and other Applied resources; inhibit Applied\\u2019s ability to sell its products;\\u00a0result in adverse judgments for\\ndamages, injunctive relief, penalties and \\ufb01nes; and\\u00a0negatively a\\ufb00ect Applied\\u2019s business.

Applied\\u2019s top priority\\nremains protecting the health and safety of its employees and their families, customers, suppliers and community.\\nApplied continues to support workplace \\ufb02exibility and will work to respond appropriately to the impact of COVID-19\\non its business, its customers\\u2019 and suppliers\\u2019 businesses and its communities.\\nOverview\\nApplied provides manufacturing equipment, services and software to the semiconductor, display, and related\\nindustries. Applied\\u2019s customers include manufacturers of semiconductor wafers and chips, liquid crystal and\\norganic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays, and other electronic devices. These customers may use what they\\nmanufacture in their own end products or sell the items to other companies for use in electronic products. Each of\\nApplied\\u2019s segments is subject to variable industry conditions, as demand for manufacturing equipment and\\nservices can change depending on supply and demand for chips, display technologies, and other electronic\\ndevices, as well as other factors, such as global economic, political and market conditions, and the nature and\\ntiming of technological advances in fabrication processes.\\nApplied operates in three reportable segments: Semiconductor Systems, Applied Global Services, and Display\\nand Adjacent Markets. A summary of \\ufb01nancial information for each reportable segment is found in Note 17 of Notes\\nto Consolidated Financial Statements. A discussion of factors that could a\\ufb00ect Applied\\u2019s operations is set forth\\nunder \\u201cRisk Factors\\u201d in Part I, Item\\u00a01A, which is incorporated herein by reference. Product development and\\nmanufacturing activities occur primarily in the United States, Europe, Israel, and Asia. Applied\\u2019s broad range of\\nequipment and service products are highly technical and are sold primarily through a direct sales force.\\n35 Table of Contents\\nApplied\\u2019s results are driven primarily by customer spending on capital equipment and services to support key\\ntechnology transitions or to increase production volume in response to worldwide demand for semiconductors and\\ndisplays. Spending by semiconductor customers, which include companies that operate in the foundry, logic,\\nmemory, and other semiconductor chip markets, is driven by demand for electronic products, including\\nsmartphones and other mobile devices, servers, personal computers, automotive devices, storage, and other\\nproducts. The growth of data and emerging end-market drivers such as arti\\ufb01cial intelligence, the Internet of Things,\\n5G networks, smart vehicles and augmented and virtual reality are also creating the next wave of growth for the\\nindustry. As a result, products within the Semiconductor Systems segment are subject to signi\\ufb01cant changes in\\ncustomer requirements, including transitions to smaller dimensions, increasingly complex chip architectures, new\\nmaterials and an increasing number of applications. Demand for display manufacturing equipment spending\\ndepends primarily on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced TVs as well as larger and higher\\nresolution displays for next-generation mobile devices, and investments in new types of display technologies. While\\ncertain existing technologies may be adapted to new requirements, some applications create the need for an\\nentirely di\\ufb00erent technological approach. The timing of customer investment in manufacturing equipment is also\\na\\ufb00ected by the timing of next-generation process development and the timing of capacity expansion to meet end-\\nmarket demand. In light of these conditions, Applied\\u2019s results can vary signi\\ufb01cantly year-over-year, as well as\\nquarter-over-quarter.\\nApplied\\u2019s strategic priorities include developing products that help solve customers\\u2019 challenges at technology\\nin\\ufb02ections; expanding its served market opportunities in the semiconductor and display industries; and growing its\\nservices business. Applied\\u2019s long-term growth strategy requires continued development of new materials\\nengineering capabilities, including products and platforms that enable expansion into new and adjacent markets.\\nApplied\\u2019s signi\\ufb01cant investments in research, development and engineering must generally enable it to deliver new\\nproducts and technologies before the emergence of strong demand, thus allowing customers to incorporate these\\nproducts into their manufacturing plans during early-stage technology selection. Applied works closely with its\\nglobal customers to design systems and processes that meet their planned technical and production requirements.\\nThe following table presents certain signi\\ufb01cant measurements for the past three \\ufb01scal years:\\n\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Change\\n2022 2021 20202022 over\\n20212021 over\\n2020\\n\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0 (In millions, except per share amounts and percentages)\\nNet sales $ 25,785\\u00a0$ 23,063\\u00a0$ 17,202\\u00a0$ 2,722\\u00a0$ 5,861\\u00a0\\nGross margin 46.5\\u00a0% 47.3\\u00a0% 44.7\\u00a0%(0.8) points2.6 points\\nOperating income $ 7,788\\u00a0$ 6,889\\u00a0$ 4,365\\u00a0$ 899\\u00a0$ 2,524\\u00a0\\nOperating margin 30.2\\u00a0% 29.9\\u00a0% 25.4\\u00a0%0.3 points 4.5 points\\nNet income $ 6,525\\u00a0$ 5,888\\u00a0$ 3,619\\u00a0$ 637\\u00a0$ 2,269\\u00a0\\nEarnings per diluted share $ 7.44\\u00a0$ 6.40\\u00a0$ 3.92\\u00a0$ 1.04\\u00a0$ 2.48\\u00a0\\nFiscal 2022 and \\ufb01scal 2020 each contained 52 weeks, while \\ufb01scal 2021 contained 53 weeks.\\nSemiconductor equipment customers continued to make strategic investments in new technology transitions\\nand new capacity during \\ufb01scal 2022.

Applied\\u2019s Display and Adjacent Markets revenue decreased in\\n\\ufb01scal 2022 compared to \\ufb01scal 2021 primarily due to decreased investment in display manufacturing equipment for\\nTVs and mobile products.\\nWhile customer demand increased during \\ufb01scal 2022 compared to \\ufb01scal 2021, supply chain and logistics\\nconstraints impacted Applied\\u2019s ability to ful\\ufb01ll demand in \\ufb01scal 2022. Although there have been improvements in\\nsupply chain performance, Applied expects some shortages to persist into \\ufb01scal 2023 and managing these supply\\nchain constraints to increase shipments to customers remains a top priority.\\nIn \\ufb01scal 2023, Applied expects memory customers\\u2019 spending to be lower as compared to \\ufb01scal 2022 due to\\nsome customers deferring capacity additions as a result of weakness in consumer electronics and personal\\ncomputer markets. Advanced foundry and logic demand is expected to remain strong in \\ufb01scal 2023 as customers\\ncontinue to invest in new technology.\\n36 Table of Contents\\nOn October 7, 2022, the United States government announced new export regulations for U.S. semiconductor\\ntechnology sold in China, including wafer fabrication equipment and related parts and services, that require export\\nlicenses and authorizations. These new export regulations resulted in lower net sales in China than expected for\\n\\ufb01scal 2022. Applied is pursuing additional export licenses and authorizations where needed. While Applied currently\\nestimates lower net sales to China of up to $2.5 billion and lower overall gross margin of up to 1% in \\ufb01scal 2023,\\nApplied is continuing to assess the implication of these complex regulations to its business.

As of October\\u00a030, 2022, Applied did not have any commercial\\npaper outstanding but may issue commercial paper notes under this program from time to time in the future.\\nSubsequent to the end of \\ufb01scal 2022, Applied issued $200\\u00a0million of short-term commercial paper with a weighted-\\naverage interest rate of 4.30% and maturities ranging from 43 days to 71 days. The commercial paper program is\\nbackstopped by the Revolving Credit Agreement and borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement reduce the\\namount of commercial paper notes Applied can issue.\\nApplied had senior unsecured notes in the aggregate principal amount of $5.5 billion outstanding as of\\nOctober\\u00a030, 2022. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for additional\\ndiscussion of existing debt. Applied may seek to re\\ufb01nance its existing debt and may incur additional indebtedness\\ndepending on Applied\\u2019s capital requirements and the availability of \\ufb01nancing.\\nOthers\\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act). The Tax Act requires\\na one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The transition tax expense is\\npayable in installments over eight years, with eight percent due in each of the \\ufb01rst \\ufb01ve years starting with \\ufb01scal\\n2018. As of October\\u00a030, 2022, Applied had $694 million of total payments remaining, payable in installments in the\\nnext four years.\\nBeginning in \\ufb01scal 2023, the Tax Act eliminates the option to deduct research and development expenditures\\ncurrently and requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize them over \\ufb01ve or \\ufb01fteen years. Although Congress is\\nconsidering legislation that would defer the capitalization and amortization requirement, there is no assurance that\\nthe provision will be repealed or otherwise modi\\ufb01ed. If the requirement is not modi\\ufb01ed, it may reduce our cash\\n\\ufb02ows beginning in \\ufb01scal 2023.\\nAlthough cash requirements will \\ufb02uctuate based on the timing and extent of factors such as those discussed\\nabove, Applied\\u2019s management believes that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided\\nby existing cash balances and borrowing capability, will be su\\ufb03cient to satisfy Applied\\u2019s liquidity requirements for\\nthe next 12\\u00a0months. For further details regarding Applied\\u2019s operating, investing and \\ufb01nancing activities, see the\\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows in this report.\\nFor details on standby letters of credit, guarantee instruments and other agreements with banks, see O\\ufb00-\\nBalance Sheet Arrangements below.\\n47 Table of Contents\\nContractual Obligations and O\\ufb00-Balance Sheet Arrangements\\nApplied has certain on-balance sheet and o\\ufb00-balance sheet obligation arrangements to make future payments\\nunder various contracts. Certain contractual arrangements which are recorded on Applied\\u2019s balance sheet include\\nborrowing facilities and debts and operating leases obligations.\\nBorrowing Facilities and Debt Obligations\\nAs of October\\u00a030, 2022, Applied has $5.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes with\\nvarying maturities. Future interest payments associated with these unsecured notes were $3.0 billion, of which\\n$205 million is due within 12 months and the remaining interest payments are due beyond 12 months. See Note\\n10, Borrowing Facilities and Debt, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion\\nrelated to Applied\\u2019s borrowing facilities and debt obligations.\\nOperating Lease Obligations\\nAs of October\\u00a030, 2022, Applied\\u2019s operating lease obligation was $407 million related to various operating\\nlease arrangements for certain facilities and equipment. See Note 11, Lease, of the Notes to the Consolidated\\nFinancial Statements for further discussion relating to these operating lease obligations.\\nPurchase Obligations\\nAs of October\\u00a030, 2022, Applied has $7.3 billion of purchase obligations for goods and services, of which $7.0\\nbillion is payable within 12 months and the remaining amount is payable beyond 12 months.\\nDeemed Repatriation Tax Payable\\nAs of October\\u00a030, 2022, Applied has $694 million of transition tax liability, of which $82 million is payable\\nwithin 12 months and the remaining amount is payable beyond 12 months. This transition tax liability is associated\\nwith the deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs\\nAct into law on December 22, 2017.\\nOther Long-term Liabilities\\nApplied also has the obligation to fund its pension, postretirement and deferred compensation plans. Applied\\nevaluates the need to make contributions to its pension and postretirement bene\\ufb01t plans after considering the\\nfunded status of the plans, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets and related tax\\nconsequences. Payments to the plans would be dependent on these factors and could vary across a wide range of\\namounts and time periods. Payments for deferred compensation plans are dependent on activity by participants,\\nmaking the timing of payments uncertain. Information on Applied\\u2019s pension, postretirement bene\\ufb01t and deferred\\ncompensation plans is presented in Note 14, Employee Bene\\ufb01t Plans, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial\\nStatements.\\nAs of October\\u00a030, 2022, the gross liability for unrecognized tax bene\\ufb01ts that was not expected to result in\\npayment of cash within one year was $489 million. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions that\\nwere not expected to result in payment of cash within one year of October\\u00a030, 2022 was $103 million. At this time,\\nApplied is unable to reliably estimate the timing of payments due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit\\noutcomes.\\nO\\ufb00-Balance Sheet Arrangements\\nIn the ordinary course of business, Applied provides standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to\\nthird parties as required for certain transactions initiated by either Applied or its subsidiaries. These include\\nagreements with various banks to facilitate subsidiary banking operations worldwide, including overdraft\\narrangements. Applied also has agreements with various banks to facilitate subsidiary banking operations\\nworldwide, including overdraft arrangements, issuance of bank guarantees, and letters of credit. See Note 16,\\nWarranty, Guarantees, Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for\\nfurther discussion relating to these arrangements.\\n48 Table of Contents\\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\\nThe preparation of consolidated \\ufb01nancial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting\\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make judgments,\\nassumptions and estimates that a\\ufb00ect the amounts reported. Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\ndescribes the signi\\ufb01cant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated \\ufb01nancial statements.\\nCertain of these signi\\ufb01cant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies.\\nA critical accounting policy is de\\ufb01ned as one that is both material to the presentation of Applied\\u2019s consolidated\\n\\ufb01nancial statements and that requires management to make di\\ufb03cult, subjective or complex judgments that could\\nhave a material e\\ufb00ect on Applied\\u2019s \\ufb01nancial condition or results of operations. Speci\\ufb01cally, these policies have the\\nfollowing attributes: (1)\\u00a0Applied is required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the\\ntime of the estimate; and (2)\\u00a0di\\ufb00erent estimates Applied could reasonably have used, or changes in the estimate\\nthat are reasonably likely to occur, would have a material e\\ufb00ect on Applied\\u2019s \\ufb01nancial condition or results of\\noperations.\\nEstimates and assumptions about future events and their e\\ufb00ects cannot be determined with certainty. Applied\\nbases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and\\nreasonable under the circumstances. These estimates may change as new events occur, as additional information\\nis obtained and as Applied\\u2019s operating environment changes. These changes have historically been minor and have\\nbeen included in the consolidated \\ufb01nancial statements as soon as they became known. In addition, management is\\nperiodically faced with uncertainties, the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for\\nprolonged periods of time. These uncertainties include those discussed in Part\\u00a0I, Item\\u00a01A, \\u201cRisk Factors.\\u201d Based on a\\ncritical assessment of its accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties a\\ufb00ecting the\\napplication of those policies, management believes that Applied\\u2019s consolidated \\ufb01nancial statements are fairly\\nstated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and provide a\\nmeaningful presentation of Applied\\u2019s \\ufb01nancial condition and results of operations.\\nManagement believes that the following are critical accounting policies and estimates:\\nRevenue Recognition\\nApplied recognizes revenue when promised goods or services (performance obligations) are transferred to a\\ncustomer in an amount that re\\ufb02ects the consideration to which Applied expects to be entitled in exchange for those\\ngoods or services. Applied performs the following \\ufb01ve steps to determine when to recognize revenue: (1)\\nidenti\\ufb01cation of the contract(s) with customers, (2) identi\\ufb01cation of the performance obligations in the contract, (3)\\ndetermination of the transaction price, (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the\\ncontract, and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, a performance obligation is satis\\ufb01ed. Management uses\\njudgment to identify performance obligations within a contract and to determine whether multiple promised goods\\nor services in a contract should be accounted for separately or as a group. Judgment is also used in interpreting\\ncommercial terms and determining when transfer of control occurs. Moreover, judgment is used to estimate the\\ncontract\\u2019s transaction price and allocate it to each performance obligation. Any material changes in the\\nidenti\\ufb01cation of performance obligations, determination and allocation of the transaction price to performance\\nobligations, and determination of when transfer of control occurs to the customer, could impact the timing and\\namount of revenue recognition, which could have a material e\\ufb00ect on Applied\\u2019s \\ufb01nancial condition and results of\\noperations.\\nWarranty Costs\\nApplied provides for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue is recognized. Estimated warranty costs are\\ndetermined by analyzing speci\\ufb01c product, current and historical con\\ufb01guration statistics and regional warranty\\nsupport costs. Applied\\u2019s warranty obligation is a\\ufb00ected by product and component failure rates, material usage and\\nlabor costs incurred in correcting product failures during the warranty period. As Applied\\u2019s customer engineers and\\nprocess support engineers are highly trained and deployed globally, labor availability is a signi\\ufb01cant factor in\\ndetermining labor costs. The quantity and availability of critical replacement parts is another signi\\ufb01cant factor in\\nestimating warranty costs. Unforeseen component failures or exceptional component performance can also result\\nin changes to warranty costs. If actual warranty costs di\\ufb00er substantially from Applied\\u2019s estimates, revisions to the\\nestimated warranty liability would be required, which could have a material e\\ufb00ect on Applied\\u2019s business, \\ufb01nancial\\ncondition and results of operations.\\n49 Table of Contents\\nAllowance for Credit Losses\\nApplied maintains an allowance for credit losses for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its\\ncustomers to make required payments. This allowance is based on historical experience, credit evaluations, speci\\ufb01c\\ncustomer collection history and any customer-speci\\ufb01c issues Applied has identi\\ufb01ed. Changes in circumstances,\\nsuch as an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer\\u2019s ability to meet its \\ufb01nancial obligation to\\nApplied or its payment trends, may require Applied to further adjust its estimates of the recoverability of amounts\\ndue to Applied, which could have a material adverse e\\ufb00ect on Applied\\u2019s business, \\ufb01nancial condition and results of\\noperations.\\nInventory Valuation\\nInventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined on a \\ufb01rst-in,\\n\\ufb01rst-out (FIFO) basis. The carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the di\\ufb00erence\\nbetween its cost and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand. Applied\\nevaluates the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing\\nhistorical and anticipated demand. In addition, inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the\\ne\\ufb00ect of known and anticipated engineering change orders and new products. If actual demand were to be\\nsubstantially lower than estimated, additional adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory may be required, which\\ncould have a material adverse e\\ufb00ect on Applied\\u2019s business, \\ufb01nancial condition and results of operations.\\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\\nApplied reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each \\ufb01scal\\nyear and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be\\nrecoverable. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets requires\\nsigni\\ufb01cant judgment, especially in emerging markets. When reviewing goodwill for impairment, Applied \\ufb01rst\\nperforms a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting\\nunit is less than its carrying value.\\nIn performing a qualitative assessment, Applied considers business conditions and other factors including, but\\nnot limited to (i) adverse industry or economic trends, (ii) restructuring actions and lower projections that may\\nimpact future operating results, (iii) sustained decline in share price, and (iv) overall \\ufb01nancial performance and\\nother events a\\ufb00ecting the reporting units. If Applied concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a\\nreporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then a quantitative impairment test is performed by estimating the\\nfair value of the reporting unit and comparing it to its carrying value. If the carrying value of a reporting unit\\nexceeds its fair value, Applied would record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value of the\\nreporting unit over its fair value.\\nApplied determines the fair value of each reporting unit based on a weighting of an income and a market\\napproach. Applied bases the fair value estimates on assumptions that it believes to be reasonable but that are\\nunpredictable and inherently uncertain. Under the income approach, Applied estimates the fair value based on\\ndiscounted cash \\ufb02ow method.\\nThe estimates used in the impairment testing are consistent with the discrete forecasts that Applied uses to\\nmanage its business, and considers any signi\\ufb01cant developments during the period. Under the discounted cash\\n\\ufb02ow method, cash \\ufb02ows beyond the discrete forecasts are estimated using a terminal growth rate, which considers\\nthe long-term earnings growth rate speci\\ufb01c to the reporting units. The estimated future cash \\ufb02ows are discounted\\nto present value using each reporting unit\\u2019s weighted average cost of capital. The weighted average cost of capital\\nmeasures a reporting unit\\u2019s cost of debt and equity \\ufb01nancing weighted by the percentage of debt and equity in a\\nreporting unit\\u2019s target capital structure. In addition, the weighted average cost of capital is derived using both\\nknown and estimated market metrics, and is adjusted to re\\ufb02ect both the timing and risks associated with the\\nestimated cash \\ufb02ows. The tax rate used in the discounted cash \\ufb02ow method is the median tax rate of comparable\\ncompanies and re\\ufb02ects Applied\\u2019s current international structure, which is consistent with the market participant\\nperspective. Under the market approach, Applied uses the guideline company method which applies market\\nmultiples to forecasted revenues and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Applied uses\\nmarket multiples that are consistent with comparable publicly-traded companies and considers each reporting\\nunit\\u2019s size, growth and pro\\ufb01tability relative to its comparable companies.\\nIntangible assets, such as purchased technology, are generally recorded in connection with a business\\nacquisition. The value assigned to intangible assets is usually based on estimates and judgments regarding\\nexpectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired. If actual product acceptance\\ndi\\ufb00ers signi\\ufb01cantly from the estimates, Applied may be required to record an impairment charge to reduce the\\ncarrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value.\\n50  Table of Contents\\nIncome Taxes\\nApplied\\u2019s provision for income taxes and e\\ufb00ective tax rate are a\\ufb00ected by the geographical composition of\\npre-tax income which includes jurisdictions with di\\ufb00ering tax rates, conditional reduced tax rates and other income\\ntax incentives. It is also a\\ufb00ected by events that are not consistent from period to period, such as changes to\\nincome tax laws and the resolution of prior years\\u2019 income tax \\ufb01lings.\\nApplied recognizes a current tax liability for the estimated amount of income tax payable on tax returns for\\nthe current \\ufb01scal year. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax e\\ufb00ects of\\ntemporary di\\ufb00erences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are also\\nrecognized for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are o\\ufb00set by a valuation\\nallowance to the extent it is more likely than not that they are not expected to be realized.\\nApplied recognizes tax bene\\ufb01ts from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax\\nposition will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position.\\nThe tax bene\\ufb01ts recognized from such positions are estimated based on the largest bene\\ufb01t that has a greater than\\n50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Any changes in judgment related to uncertain tax\\npositions are recognized in Applied\\u2019s provision for income taxes in the quarter in which such change occurs.\\nInterest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in Applied\\u2019s provision for income taxes.\\nThe calculation of Applied\\u2019s provision for income taxes and e\\ufb00ective tax rate involves signi\\ufb01cant judgment in\\nestimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a\\nmanner inconsistent with Applied\\u2019s expectations could have a material impact on Applied\\u2019s results of operations\\nand \\ufb01nancial condition.\\n51 Table of Contents\\nNon-GAAP Adjusted Financial Results\\nManagement uses non-GAAP adjusted \\ufb01nancial measures to evaluate the Company\\u2019s operating and \\ufb01nancial\\nperformance and for planning purposes, and as performance measures in its executive compensation program.\\nApplied believes these measures enhance an overall understanding of its performance and investors\\u2019 ability to\\nreview the Company\\u2019s business from the same perspective as the Company\\u2019s management and facilitate\\ncomparisons of this period\\u2019s results with prior periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that management\\ndoes not believe are indicative of Applied\\u2019s ongoing operating performance.\\nThe non-GAAP adjusted \\ufb01nancial measures presented below are adjusted to exclude the impact of certain\\ncosts, expenses, gains and losses, including certain items related to mergers and acquisitions; restructuring and\\nseverance charges and any associated adjustments; certain incremental expenses related to COVID-19;\\nimpairments of assets; gain or loss on strategic investments; loss on early extinguishment of debt; certain income\\ntax items and other discrete adjustments.

The market value of Applied\\u2019s investments in available-for-sale securities\\nwas approximately $1.8 billion at October\\u00a030, 2022. An immediate hypothetical 100\\u00a0basis point increase in interest\\nrates would result in a decrease in the fair value of investments as of October\\u00a030, 2022 of approximately\\n$23\\u00a0million.\\nDebt. At October\\u00a030, 2022, the aggregate principal of long-term senior unsecured notes issued by Applied was\\n$5.5 billion with an estimated fair value of $4.8 billion. A hypothetical decrease in interest rates of 100 basis points\\nwould result in an increase in the fair value of Applied\\u2019s long-term senior notes issuances of approximately $454\\nmillion at October\\u00a030, 2022. From time to time Applied uses interest rate swaps or rate lock agreements to mitigate\\nthe potential impact of changes in benchmark interest rates on interest expense and cash \\ufb02ows.\\nForeign Currency Risk\\nCertain operations of Applied are conducted in foreign currencies, such as Japanese yen, Israeli shekel, euro\\nand Taiwanese dollar. Hedges are used to reduce, but not eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate\\nmovements on the consolidated balance sheet, statement of operations, and statement of cash \\ufb02ows.\\nApplied uses primarily foreign currency forward contracts to o\\ufb00set the impact of foreign exchange movements\\non non-U.S. dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities. The foreign exchange gains and losses on the\\nassets and liabilities are recorded in interest and other income (net) and are o\\ufb00set by the gains and losses on the\\nhedges.\\nApplied uses foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge a portion of anticipated non-U.S. dollar\\ndenominated revenues and expenses expected to occur within the next 24 months. Gains and losses on these\\nhedging contracts generally mitigate the e\\ufb00ect of currency movements on Applied\\u2019s net sales, cost of products\\nsold, and operating expenses. A hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates relative to\\nthe U.S. Dollar would result in a decrease in the fair value of these hedging contracts of $196 million at October\\u00a030,\\n2022.\\nApplied does not use foreign currency forward or option contracts for trading or speculative purposes.\\nItem 8:\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\\nThe consolidated \\ufb01nancial statements required by this Item are set forth on the pages indicated at Item\\u00a015(a).\\nItem 9:\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\\nNone.\\n56 Table of Contents\\nItem 9A:\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0Controls and Procedures\\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\\nAs of the end of the period covered by this report, management of Applied conducted an evaluation, under the\\nsupervision and with the participation of Applied\\u2019s Chief Executive O\\ufb03cer and Chief Financial O\\ufb03cer, of the\\ne\\ufb00ectiveness of Applied\\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is de\\ufb01ned in Rule\\u00a013a-15(e) of the\\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act).

Our responsibility is\\nto express an opinion on these consolidated \\ufb01nancial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting\\n\\ufb01rm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance\\nwith the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange\\nCommission and the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated \\ufb01nancial statements are free of\\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the\\nrisks of material misstatement of the consolidated \\ufb01nancial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and\\nperforming procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence\\nregarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated \\ufb01nancial statements. Our audits also included\\nevaluating the accounting principles used and signi\\ufb01cant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating\\nthe overall presentation of the consolidated \\ufb01nancial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable\\nbasis for our opinion.\\nCritical Audit Matter\\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated\\n\\ufb01nancial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1)\\nrelates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated \\ufb01nancial statements and (2) involved our\\nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not\\nalter in any way our opinion on the consolidated \\ufb01nancial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by\\ncommunicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the\\naccounts or disclosures to which it relates.\\n62 Table of Contents\\nEvaluation of net realizable value adjustments to inventories for excess or obsolescence\\nAs discussed in notes 1 and 8 to the consolidated \\ufb01nancial statements, the Company has inventories with a\\ncarrying value of $5,932 million as of October 30, 2022. The Company adjusts inventory carrying value for\\nestimated excess or obsolescence equal to the di\\ufb00erence between cost of inventory and the estimated net\\nrealizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual demand were to\\nbe substantially lower than estimated, there could be a signi\\ufb01cant adverse impact on the carrying value of\\ninventories and results of operations.\\nWe identi\\ufb01ed the evaluation of net realizable value adjustments to certain inventories for excess or\\nobsolescence as a critical audit matter. Evaluation of the Company\\u2019s estimates regarding forecasted sales and\\ninventory consumption involved a high degree of auditor judgment.\\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the\\ndesign and tested the operating e\\ufb00ectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company\\u2019s process for\\ndetermining net realizable value adjustments for inventory excess or obsolescence, including controls related to\\nestimating forecasted sales and inventory consumption. We evaluated certain inventories for excess or\\nobsolescence by comparing the Company\\u2019s sales and inventory consumption forecast to historical sales,\\nhistorical inventory usage, known customer orders, and industry outlook reports. In addition, for certain\\ninventories, we compared the Company\\u2019s historical estimates of net realizable value adjustments for excess\\nand obsolescence to the actual physical inventory disposals to evaluate the Company\\u2019s ability to accurately\\nestimate the net realizable value adjustments.\\n/S/\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0KPMG LLP\\nKPMG LLP\\nWe have served as the Company\\u2019s auditor since 2004.\\nSanta Clara, California\\nDecember\\u00a016, 2022\\n63 Table of Contents\\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\\nApplied Materials, Inc.:\\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\\nWe have audited Applied Materials, Inc. and subsidiaries\\u2019 (the Company) internal control over \\ufb01nancial reporting as\\nof October\\u00a030, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the\\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on\\nthe Company\\u2019s internal control over \\ufb01nancial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting \\ufb01rm\\nregistered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the\\nU.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission\\nand the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether e\\ufb00ective internal control over \\ufb01nancial reporting\\nwas maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over \\ufb01nancial reporting included obtaining an\\nunderstanding of internal control over \\ufb01nancial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and\\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating e\\ufb00ectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our\\naudit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe\\nthat our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\\nDe\\ufb01nition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\\nA company\\u2019s internal control over \\ufb01nancial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\\nregarding the reliability of \\ufb01nancial reporting and the preparation of \\ufb01nancial statements for external purposes in\\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\\u2019s internal control over \\ufb01nancial reporting\\nincludes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\\naccurately and fairly re\\ufb02ect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable\\nassurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of \\ufb01nancial statements in accordance\\nwith generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made\\nonly in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable\\nassurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the\\ncompany\\u2019s assets that could have a material e\\ufb00ect on the \\ufb01nancial statements.\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over \\ufb01nancial reporting may not prevent or detect\\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of e\\ufb00ectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the\\npolicies or procedures may deteriorate.\\n\\u00a0 /s/\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0KPMG LLP\\nKPMG LLP\\nSanta Clara, California\\nDecember\\u00a016, 2022\\n64 Table of

Contents\\nNote 1\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 Summary of Signi\\ufb01cant Accounting Policies\\nPrinciples of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation\\nThe consolidated \\ufb01nancial statements include the accounts of Applied Materials, Inc. and its subsidiaries\\n(Applied or the Company) after elimination of intercompany balances and transactions. All references to a \\ufb01scal\\nyear apply to Applied\\u2019s \\ufb01scal year which ends on the last Sunday in October. Fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 contained\\n52, 53 and 52 weeks, respectively. Each \\ufb01scal quarter of 2022 and 2020 contained 13\\u00a0weeks. The \\ufb01rst \\ufb01scal quarter\\nof 2021 contained 14 weeks, while the second, third and fourth quarters of \\ufb01scal 2021 contained 13 weeks.\\nUse of Estimates\\nThe preparation of \\ufb01nancial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the\\nUnited States of America requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that a\\ufb00ect the\\namounts reported in the \\ufb01nancial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could di\\ufb00er materially from\\nthose estimates. On an ongoing basis, Applied evaluates its estimates, including those related to standalone selling\\nprice (SSP) related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable and sales allowances, fair values of \\ufb01nancial\\ninstruments, inventories, intangible assets and goodwill, useful lives of intangible assets and property and\\nequipment, fair values of share-based awards, and income taxes, among others. Applied bases its estimates on\\nhistorical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, the results of which\\nform the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\\nAs of October\\u00a030, 2022, the COVID-19 pandemic and worldwide response remains \\ufb02uid. As a result, many of\\nApplied\\u2019s estimates and assumptions are subject to increased judgment and volatility. These estimates may di\\ufb00er\\nmaterially in future periods as the pandemic continues to evolve and additional information becomes available.\\nCash Equivalents\\nAll highly-liquid investments with a remaining maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase are\\nconsidered to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consist primarily of investments in institutional money market\\nfunds.\\nInvestments\\nAll of Applied\\u2019s investments, except equity investments, are classi\\ufb01ed as available-for-sale at the respective\\nbalance sheet dates. Investments classi\\ufb01ed as available-for-sale are measured and recorded in the Consolidated\\nBalance Sheets at fair value, and unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, is reported as a separate component of\\nother comprehensive income. Interest earned on cash and investments, as well as realized gains and losses on sale\\nof securities, are included in interest and other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\\nApplied\\u2019s equity investments with readily determinable values consist of publicly traded equity securities.\\nThese investments are measured at fair value using quoted prices for identical assets in an active market.\\nPrivately-held equity investments without readily determinable fair value are measured at cost, less impairment,\\nadjusted by observable price changes. Adjustments resulting from impairments and observable prices changes are\\nrecorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\\nAllowance for Credit Losses\\nApplied maintains an allowance for credit losses for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its\\ncustomers to make required payments. This allowance is based on historical experience, credit evaluations, speci\\ufb01c\\ncustomer collection history and any customer-speci\\ufb01c issues Applied has identi\\ufb01ed. Changes in circumstances,\\nsuch as an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer\\u2019s ability to meet its \\ufb01nancial obligation to\\nApplied or its payment trends, may require Applied to further adjust its estimates of the recoverability of amounts\\ndue to Applied. Bad debt expense and any reversals are recorded in marketing and selling expenses in the\\nConsolidated Statement of Operations.\\nInventories\\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined on a \\ufb01rst-in, \\ufb01rst-out\\n(FIFO) basis. Applied adjusts inventory carrying value for estimated obsolescence equal to the di\\ufb00erence between\\nthe cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and\\nmarket conditions. Applied fully writes down inventories and noncancelable purchase orders for inventory deemed\\nobsolete. Applied performs periodic reviews of inventory items to identify excess inventories on hand by comparing\\non-hand balances to anticipated usage using recent historical activity as well as anticipated or forecasted demand.\\nIf estimates of customer demand diminish further or market conditions become less favorable than those projected\\nby Applied, additional inventory adjustments may be required.\\n70  Table of Contents\\nAPPLIED MATERIALS, INC.\\nNOTES\\u00a0TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\u2014 (Continued)\\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\\nProperty, plant and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful lives of the\\nassets using the straight-line method. Estimated useful lives for \\ufb01nancial reporting purposes are as follows:\\nbuildings and improvements, 3 to 30 years; demonstration and manufacturing equipment, 3 \\u00a0to 5 years; software, 3\\nto 5 years; and furniture, \\ufb01xtures and other equipment, 3 to 5 years. Land improvements are amortized over the\\nshorter of 15 years\\u00a0or the estimated useful life. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of \\ufb01ve\\nyears or the lease term.\\nIntangible Assets\\nGoodwill and inde\\ufb01nite-lived assets are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment annually during the\\nfourth quarter of each \\ufb01scal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying\\nvalue of an asset may not be recoverable. Purchased technology and other intangible assets are presented at cost,\\nnet of accumulated amortization, and are amortized over their estimated useful lives of 1 to 15 years using the\\nstraight-line method.\\nLong-Lived Assets\\nApplied reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that\\nthe carrying amount of these assets or asset group may not be recoverable. Applied assesses these assets for\\nimpairment based on estimated future cash \\ufb02ows from these assets.\\nRevenue Recognition from Contracts with Customers\\nApplied recognizes revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to a customer in an amount that\\nre\\ufb02ects the consideration to which Applied expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Applied\\ndetermines revenue recognition through the following \\ufb01ve steps: (1) identi\\ufb01cation of the contract(s) with\\ncustomers, (2) identi\\ufb01cation of the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determination of the transaction\\nprice, (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognition of\\nrevenue when, or as, a performance obligation is satis\\ufb01ed.\\nIdentifying the contract(s) with customers. Applied sells manufacturing equipment, services, and spare parts\\ndirectly to its customers in the semiconductor, display, and related industries. The Company generally considers\\nwritten documentation including, but not limited to, signed purchase orders, master agreements, and sales orders\\nas contracts provided that collection is probable. Collectability is assessed based on the customer\\u2019s\\ncreditworthiness determined by reviewing the customer\\u2019s published credit and \\ufb01nancial information, historical\\npayment experience, as well as other relevant factors.\\nIdentifying the performance obligations. Applied\\u2019s performance obligations include delivery of manufacturing\\nequipment, service agreements, spare parts, installation, extended warranty and training. Applied\\u2019s service\\nagreements are considered one performance obligation and may include multiple goods and services that Applied\\nprovides to the customer to deliver against a performance metric. Judgment is used to determine whether multiple\\npromised goods or services in a contract should be accounted for separately or as a group.\\nDetermine the transaction price. The transaction price for Applied\\u2019s contracts with customers may include\\n\\ufb01xed and variable consideration. Applied includes variable consideration in the transaction price to the extent that\\nit is probable that a signi\\ufb01cant reversal of revenue will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable\\nconsideration is subsequently resolved.\\nAllocate the transaction price to the performance obligations. A contract\\u2019s transaction price is allocated to\\neach distinct performance obligation identi\\ufb01ed within the contract. Applied generally estimates the standalone\\nselling price of a distinct performance obligation based on historical cost plus an appropriate margin. For contracts\\nwith multiple performance obligations, Applied allocates the contract\\u2019s transaction price to each performance\\nobligation using the relative standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract.\\nRecognizing the revenue as performance obligations are satis\\ufb01ed. Applied recognizes revenue from equipment\\nand spares parts at a point in time when Applied has satis\\ufb01ed its performance obligation by transferring control of\\nthe goods to the customer which typically occurs at shipment or delivery. Revenue from service agreements is\\nrecognized over time, typically within 12 months, as customers receive the bene\\ufb01ts of services.\\nThe incremental costs to obtain a contract are not material.\\n71 Table of Contents\\nAPPLIED MATERIALS, INC.\\nNOTES\\u00a0TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\u2014 (Continued)\\nPayment Terms. Payment terms vary by contract. Generally, the majority of payments are due within a certain\\nnumber of days from shipment of goods or performance of service. The remainder is typically due upon customer\\ntechnical acceptance. Applied typically receives deposits on future deliverables from customers in the\\nSemiconductor Systems and Display and Adjacent Markets segments and, in certain instances, may also receive\\ndeposits from customers in the Applied Global Services segment. Applied\\u2019s payment terms do not generally contain\\na signi\\ufb01cant \\ufb01nancing component.\\nShipping and Handling Costs\\nApplied accounts for shipping and handling activities related to contracts with customers as costs to ful\\ufb01ll our\\npromise to transfer the associated products. Accordingly, amounts billed for shipping and handling costs are\\nrecorded as a component of net sales and costs as a component of cost of products sold.\\nWarranty\\nApplied provides for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue is recognized. Estimated warranty costs are\\ndetermined by analyzing speci\\ufb01c product, current and historical con\\ufb01guration statistics and regional warranty\\nsupport costs. Applied\\u2019s warranty obligation is a\\ufb00ected by product and component failure rates, material usage and\\nlabor costs incurred in correcting product failures during the warranty period. If actual warranty costs di\\ufb00er\\nsubstantially from Applied\\u2019s estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required.\\nApplied also sells extended warranty contracts to its customers which provide an extension of the standard\\nwarranty coverage period of up to 2 years. Applied receives payment at the inception of the contract and\\nrecognizes revenue ratably over the extended warranty coverage period, as the customer simultaneously receives\\nand consumes the bene\\ufb01ts of the extended warranty.\\nSales and Value Added Taxes\\nTaxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are presented on a net basis in the\\nConsolidated Statements of Operations.\\nResearch, Development and Engineering Costs\\nResearch, development and engineering costs are expensed as incurred.\\nIncome Taxes\\nApplied recognizes a current tax liability for the estimated amount of income tax payable on tax returns for the\\ncurrent \\ufb01scal year. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax e\\ufb00ects of\\ntemporary di\\ufb00erences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are also\\nrecognized for net operating loss and tax credit carryovers. Deferred tax assets are o\\ufb00set by a valuation allowance\\nto the extent it is more likely than not that they are not expected to be realized.\\nApplied recognizes tax bene\\ufb01ts from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax\\nposition will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.\\nThe tax bene\\ufb01ts recognized from such positions are estimated based on the largest bene\\ufb01t that has a greater than\\n50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Any changes in judgment related to uncertain tax\\npositions are recognized in Applied\\u2019s provision for income taxes in the quarter in which such change occurs.\\nInterest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in Applied\\u2019s provision for income taxes.\\n72 Table of Contents\\nAPPLIED MATERIALS, INC.\\nNOTES\\u00a0TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\u2014 (Continued)\\nDerivative Financial Instruments\\nApplied uses \\ufb01nancial instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge a portion\\nof, but not all, existing and anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions typically expected to occur\\nwithin 24 months. The purpose of Applied\\u2019s foreign currency management is to mitigate the e\\ufb00ect of exchange rate\\n\\ufb02uctuations on certain foreign currency denominated revenues, costs and eventual cash \\ufb02ows. In certain cases,\\nApplied also uses interest rate swap or lock agreements to hedge against the variability of cash \\ufb02ows due to\\nchanges in the benchmark interest rate of \\ufb01xed rate debt. The terms of derivative \\ufb01nancial instruments used for\\nhedging purposes are generally consistent with the timing of the transactions being hedged. Applied\\u2019s derivative\\n\\ufb01nancial instruments are recorded as assets or liabilities at fair value and reported at gross on its Consolidated\\nBalance Sheets. However, under master netting agreements in place with its counterparties, Applied may net settle\\ntransactions of the same currency under certain circumstances. For derivative instruments designated and\\nqualifying as cash \\ufb02ow hedges, the gain or loss is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive\\nincome (loss) in stockholders\\u2019 equity, and is reclassi\\ufb01ed into earnings when the hedged transaction a\\ufb00ects\\nearnings. Any portion excluded from the assessment of e\\ufb00ectiveness is recognized in the same line as the hedged\\ntransaction but may be recognized in a di\\ufb00erent manner, e.g. amortized. If a hedged transaction becomes probable\\nof not occurring according to the original strategy, the hedge relationship is discontinued and the gain or loss on\\nthe associated derivative is recorded promptly in earnings. For hedges of existing foreign currency denominated\\nassets or liabilities, the gain or loss is recorded promptly in earnings to o\\ufb00set the changes in the fair value of the\\nassets or liabilities being hedged.\\nForeign Currency\\nAs of October\\u00a030, 2022, all of Applied\\u2019s subsidiaries use the United States dollar as their functional currency.\\nAccordingly, assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are remeasured using exchange rates in e\\ufb00ect at the end of\\nthe period, except for non-monetary assets, such as inventories and property, plant and equipment, which are\\nremeasured using historical exchange rates. Foreign currency-denominated revenues and costs are remeasured\\nusing average exchange rates for the period, except for costs related to the non-monetary assets and liabilities,\\nwhich are remeasured using historical exchange rates. The resulting remeasurement gains and losses are included\\nin interest and other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as incurred.\\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject Applied to signi\\ufb01cant concentrations of credit risk consist\\nprincipally of cash equivalents, investments, trade accounts receivable and derivative \\ufb01nancial instruments used in\\nhedging activities. Applied invests in a variety of \\ufb01nancial instruments, such as, but not limited to, commercial\\npaper, corporate and municipal bonds, United States Treasury and agency securities, and asset-backed and\\nmortgage-backed securities, and, by policy, limits the amount of credit exposure with any one \\ufb01nancial institution\\nor commercial issuer. Applied is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties\\nto derivative \\ufb01nancial instruments, but does not expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations. Applied\\nperforms ongoing credit evaluations of its customers\\u2019 \\ufb01nancial condition and generally requires no collateral to\\nsecure accounts receivable. Applied maintains an allowance for potentially uncollectible accounts receivable based\\non its assessment of the collectability of accounts receivable. Applied regularly reviews the allowance by\\nconsidering factors such as historical experience, credit quality, age of the accounts receivable balances, and\\ncurrent economic conditions that may a\\ufb00ect a customer\\u2019s ability to pay. In addition, Applied utilizes deposits and/or\\nletters of credit to mitigate credit risk when considered appropriate.\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\\nAccounting Standards Adopted\\nSimplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standard Board\\n(FASB) issued an accounting standard update to simplify the accounting for income taxes (Topic 740). This\\namendment removes certain exceptions and improves consistent application of accounting principles for certain\\nareas in Topic 740. Applied adopted this authoritative guidance in the \\ufb01rst quarter of \\ufb01scal 2022.

In determining the fair value of investments, Applied uses pricing information from pricing\\nservices that value securities based on quoted market prices and models that utilize observable market inputs. In\\nthe event a fair value estimate is unavailable from a pricing service, Applied generally obtains non-binding price\\nquotes from brokers. Applied then reviews the information provided by the pricing services or brokers to determine\\nthe fair value of its short-term and long-term investments. In addition, to validate pricing information obtained from\\npricing services, Applied periodically performs supplemental analysis on a sample of securities.

Applied uses derivative \\ufb01nancial\\ninstruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency\\ndenominated transactions expected to occur typically within the next 24 months. The purpose of Applied\\u2019s foreign\\ncurrency management is to mitigate the e\\ufb00ect of exchange rate \\ufb02uctuations on certain foreign currency\\ndenominated revenues, costs and eventual cash \\ufb02ows. The terms of currency instruments used for hedging\\npurposes are generally consistent with the timing of the transactions being hedged.\\nApplied does not use derivative \\ufb01nancial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Derivative\\ninstruments and hedging activities, including foreign exchange and interest rate contracts, are recognized on the\\nbalance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting\\ntreatment are recognized currently in earnings. All of Applied\\u2019s derivative \\ufb01nancial instruments are recorded at\\ntheir fair value in other current assets or in accounts payable and accrued expenses.\\u00a0\\nHedges related to anticipated transactions are designated and documented at the inception of the hedge as\\ncash \\ufb02ow hedges and foreign exchange derivatives are typically entered into once per month. Cash \\ufb02ow hedges are\\nevaluated for e\\ufb00ectiveness quarterly. The e\\ufb00ective portion of the gain or loss on these hedges is reported as a\\ncomponent of AOCI in stockholders\\u2019 equity and is reclassi\\ufb01ed into earnings when the hedged transaction a\\ufb00ects\\nearnings. The majority of the after-tax net income or loss related to foreign exchange derivative instruments\\nincluded in AOCI at October\\u00a030, 2022 is expected to be reclassi\\ufb01ed into earnings within 12 months. Changes in fair\\nvalue caused by changes in time value of option contracts designated as cash \\ufb02ow hedges are excluded from the\\nassessment of e\\ufb00ectiveness. The initial value of this excluded component is amortized on a straight-line basis over\\nthe life of the hedging instrument and recognized in the \\ufb01nancial statement line item to which the hedge relates.

Goodwill is measured as the excess of the\\npurchase price over the sum of the amounts assigned to tangible and identi\\ufb01able intangible assets acquired less\\nliabilities assumed. Applied assigns assets acquired (including goodwill) and liabilities assumed to one or more\\nreporting units as of the date of acquisition. Typically, acquisitions relate to a single reporting unit and thus do not\\nrequire the allocation of goodwill to multiple reporting units. If the products obtained in an acquisition are assigned\\nto multiple reporting units, the goodwill is distributed to the respective reporting units as part of the purchase price\\nallocation process.\\nGoodwill and purchased intangible assets with inde\\ufb01nite useful lives are not amortized but are reviewed for\\nimpairment annually during the fourth quarter of each \\ufb01scal year and whenever events or changes in\\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. The process of evaluating the\\npotential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets requires signi\\ufb01cant judgment, especially in emerging\\nmarkets. When reviewing goodwill for impairment, Applied \\ufb01rst performs a qualitative assessment to determine\\nwhether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value.\\nIn performing a qualitative assessment, Applied considers business conditions and other factors including, but\\nnot limited to (i) adverse industry or economic trends, (ii) restructuring actions and lower projections that may\\nimpact future operating results, (iii) sustained decline in share price, and (iv) overall \\ufb01nancial performance and\\nother events a\\ufb00ecting the reporting units. If Applied concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a\\nreporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then a quantitative impairment test is performed by estimating the\\nfair value of the reporting unit and comparing it to its carrying value. If the carrying value of a reporting unit\\nexceeds its fair value, Applied would record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value of the\\nreporting unit over its fair value.\\nAs of October\\u00a030, 2022, Applied\\u2019s reporting units include Semiconductor Products Group and Imaging and\\nProcess Control Group, which combine to form the Semiconductor Systems reporting segment, Applied Global\\nServices, Display and Adjacent Markets and other reporting units recorded under Corporate and Other.\\nIn the fourth quarter of \\ufb01scal 2022, Applied performed a qualitative assessment to test goodwill for all of its\\nreporting units for impairment. Applied determined that it was more likely than not that each of its reporting units\\u2019\\nfair values exceeded their respective carrying values and that it was not necessary to perform the quantitative\\ngoodwill impairment test for any of its reporting units. The evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets for\\nimpairment requires the exercise of signi\\ufb01cant judgment. In the event of future changes in business conditions,\\nApplied will be required to reassess and update its forecasts and estimates used in future impairment analyses. If\\nthe results of these future analyses are lower than current estimates, a material impairment charge may result at\\nthat time.\\n85 Table of Contents\\nAPPLIED MATERIALS, INC.\\nNOTES\\u00a0TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\u2014 (Continued)\\nDetails of goodwill and inde\\ufb01nite-lived intangible assets as of:\\n\\u00a0 October 30, 2022 October 31, 2021\\n\\u00a0 GoodwillInde\\ufb01nite-\\nlived\\nIntangible\\nAssets Total GoodwillInde\\ufb01nite-\\nlived\\nIntangible\\nAssets Total\\n\\u00a0 (In millions)\\nSemiconductor Systems $ 2,428 \\u00a0$ 16 \\u00a0$ 2,444 \\u00a0$ 2,207 \\u00a0$ \\u2014 \\u00a0$ 2,207 \\u00a0\\nApplied Global Services 1,032 \\u00a0 \\u2014 \\u00a0 1,032 \\u00a0 1,032 \\u00a0 \\u2014 \\u00a0 1,032 \\u00a0\\nDisplay and Adjacent\\nMarkets 199 \\u00a0 \\u2014 \\u00a0 199 \\u00a0 199 \\u00a0 \\u2014 \\u00a0 199 \\u00a0\\nCorporate and Other 41 \\u00a0 1 \\u00a0 42 \\u00a0 41 \\u00a0 \\u2014 \\u00a0 41 \\u00a0\\nCarrying amount $ 3,700 \\u00a0$ 17 \\u00a0$ 3,717 \\u00a0$ 3,479 \\u00a0$ \\u2014 \\u00a0$ 3,479 \\u00a0\\nFrom time to time, Applied makes acquisitions of companies related to existing or new markets for Applied.\\nDuring \\ufb01scal 2022, goodwill and inde\\ufb01nite-lived intangible assets increased by $ 221 million and $ 17 \\u00a0million,\\nrespectively, primarily due to the preliminary purchase accounting for acquisitions during the third quarter of \\ufb01scal\\n2022, which were not material to Applied\\u2019s results of operations.\\nA summary of Applied\\u2019s purchased technology and intangible assets is set forth below:\\nOctober 30,\\n2022October 31,\\n2021\\n\\u00a0 (In millions)\\nPurchased technology, net $ 256 \\u00a0$ 46 \\u00a0\\nIntangible assets - \\ufb01nite-lived, net 66 \\u00a0 58 \\u00a0\\nIntangible assets - inde\\ufb01nite-lived 17 \\u00a0 \\u2014 \\u00a0\\nTotal $ 339 \\u00a0$ 104 \\u00a0\\nThe increase in purchased technology and intangible assets during \\ufb01scal 2022 was primarily due to the\\npreliminary purchase accounting for acquisitions during the third quarter of \\ufb01scal 2022, which were not material to\\nApplied\\u2019s results of operations.\\nIntangible assets that are not subject to amortization consist primarily of in-process technology, which will be\\nsubject to amortization upon commercialization.

The value assigned to intangible assets is usually based on estimates and judgments regarding\\nexpectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired. Applied evaluates the useful lives\\nof its intangible assets each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances require revising the\\nremaining period of amortization. In addition, Applied reviews intangible assets for impairment when events or\\nchanges in circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable.

Applied calculates estimated forfeiture rate on an\\nannual basis, based on historical forfeiture activities. Share-based awards granted to certain members of senior\\nmanagement allow for partial accelerated vesting in the event of a qualifying retirement based on age and years of\\nservice. The cost associated with performance-based equity awards, which include performance and/or market\\ngoals, is recognized for each tranche over the service period. The cost of the portion of performance-based equity\\nawards subject to performance goals is recognized based on an assessment of the likelihood that the applicable\\nperformance goals will be achieved, and the cost of the portion of performance-based equity awards subject to\\nmarket goals is recognized based on the assumption of 100 % achievement of the goal.\\nAt October\\u00a030, 2022, Applied had $ 678 million in total unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated\\nforfeitures, related to grants of share-based awards and shares issued under the ESPP, which will be recognized\\nover a weighted average period of 2.6 years. At October\\u00a030, 2022, there were 31 million shares available for grant\\nof share-based awards under the ESIP, and an additional 14 million shares available for issuance under the ESPP.\\nStock Options\\nStock options are rights to purchase, at future dates, shares of Applied common stock. The exercise price of\\neach stock option equals the fair market value of Applied common stock on the date of grant. Options typically vest\\nover three to four years , subject to the grantee\\u2019s continued service with Applied through the scheduled vesting\\ndate, and expire no later than seven years from the grant date. There were no stock options granted during \\ufb01scal\\n2022, 2021 and 2020. There were no outstanding stock options at the end of \\ufb01scal 2022.\\n92 Table of Contents\\nAPPLIED MATERIALS, INC.\\nNOTES\\u00a0TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\u2014 (Continued)\\nRestricted Stock Units, Restricted Stock, Performance Share Units and Performance Units\\nRestricted stock units are converted into shares of Applied common stock upon vesting on a one-for-one basis.\\nRestricted stock has the same rights as other issued and outstanding shares of Applied common stock except these\\nshares generally have no right to dividends and are held in escrow until the award vests. Performance share units\\nand performance units are awards that result in a payment to a grantee, generally in shares of Applied common\\nstock on a one-for-one basis, if performance goals, market goals and/or other vesting criteria are achieved or the\\nawards otherwise vest. Restricted stock units, restricted stock, performance share units and performance units\\ntypically vest over three to four years and vesting is usually subject to the grantee\\u2019s continued service with Applied\\nand, in some cases, achievement of speci\\ufb01ed performance and/or market goals. The compensation expense related\\nto share-based awards subject solely to time-based vesting requirements (Service-Based Awards) is determined\\nusing the market value of Applied common stock, adjusted to exclude the present value of expected dividends\\nduring the vesting period. The market value of Applied common stock is calculated using the closing price of\\nApplied common stock on the date of grant or if the grant date is not a trading date, the average of the closing\\nprices on the trading dates immediately preceding and following the grant date. The compensation expense is\\nrecognized over the vesting period.\\nDuring \\ufb01scal 2022, 2021 and 2020, certain members of senior management were granted awards that are\\nsubject to the achievement of certain levels of speci\\ufb01ed performance and/or market goals, in addition to time-\\nbased vesting requirements (Performance Based-Awards).\\nCertain of Performance-Based Awards are subject to the achievement of targeted levels of adjusted operating\\nmargin and targeted levels of total shareholder return (TSR) relative to the TSR of the companies in the Standard &\\nPoor\\u2019s 500 Index. Each of these two metrics will be weighted 50 % and will be measured over a three-year period.\\nThe number of shares that may vest in full after three years ranges from 0 % to 200 % of the target amount. The\\nawards become eligible to vest only if the goals are achieved and will vest only if the grantee remains employed by\\nApplied through each applicable vesting date, subject to a qualifying retirement based on age and years of service.\\nThe awards provide for a partial payout based on actual performance at the conclusion of the three-year\\nperformance period in the event of a qualifying retirement.\\nDuring \\ufb01scal 2021, certain executive o\\ufb03cers were also granted non-recurring long-term Performance-Based\\nAwards that are subject to the achievement of targeted levels of Applied\\u2019s absolute TSR. The awards become\\neligible to vest only if targeted levels of TSR are achieved during a \\ufb01ve-year performance period and will vest only\\nif the grantee remains employed by Applied through the vesting date in October 2025, except in the event of\\ninvoluntary termination of employment without cause, death or following a change of control. The number of\\nshares that may vest in full after \\ufb01ve years ranges from 0 % to 200 % of the target amount.\\nThe fair value of the portion of the Performance-Based Awards subject to targeted levels of adjusted operating\\nmargin is estimated on the date of grant based on the market value of Applied common stock, adjusted to exclude\\nthe present value of expected dividends during the vesting period. The market value of Applied common stock is\\ncalculated using the closing price of Applied common stock on the date of the grant or if the grant date is not a\\ntrading date, the average of the closing prices on the trading dates immediately preceding and following the grant\\ndate. If the performance goals are not met as of the end of the performance period, no compensation expense is\\nrecognized and any previously recognized compensation expense is reversed. The expected cost is based on the\\nportion of the awards that is probable to vest and is re\\ufb02ected over the service period and reduced for estimated\\nforfeitures.\\nThe fair value of the portion of the Performance-Based Awards subject to targeted levels of relative TSR or\\nabsolute TSR is estimated on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Compensation expense is\\nrecognized based upon the assumption of 100 % achievement of the TSR goal and will not be reversed even if the\\nthreshold level of TSR is never achieved, and is re\\ufb02ected over the service period and reduced for estimated\\nforfeitures.\\n93 Table of Contents\\nAPPLIED MATERIALS, INC.\\nNOTES\\u00a0TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\u2014 (Continued)\\nThe following tables summarize the assumptions used for the valuation of share-based awards for the periods\\npresented:\\n2022 2021 2020\\nService-Based Awards and the portion of\\nPerformance-Based Awards subject to performance\\ngoals:\\nGrant date market value $ 74.62 - $\\n157.29$ 74.37 - $\\n143.05$ 39.18 - $ 66.43\\nRisk-free interest rate 0.16 % - 4.48 % 0.04 % - 0.82 % 0.11 % - 1.70 %\\nDividend yield 0.47 % - 3.83 % 0.20 % - 3.09 % 1.69 % - 6.23 %\\nFair value $ 72.24 - $\\n154.88\\u00a0$ 72.20 - $\\n140.66\\u00a0$ 37.02 - $\\n64.37\\n2022 2021 2020\\nPortion of Performance-Based Awards subject to\\nmarket goals:\\nGrant date market value $ 146.49$ 86.10 - $ 88.84 $ 55.84\\nRisk-free interest rate 0.87 \\u00a0% 0.20 % - 0.41 % 1.59 \\u00a0%\\nDividend yield 0.66 \\u00a0% 0.99 % - 1.02 % 1.50 \\u00a0%\\nExpected volatility\\n47.35 \\u00a0%40.51 % - 47.00\\n% 34.96 \\u00a0%\\nFair value\\n$ 210.69$ 129.27 - $\\n136.81 $ 74.00\\n\\u00a0________________________\\n*Fiscal 2021 included both annual and non-r ecurring long-ter m Performance- Based A wards.\\nA summary of the changes in restricted stock units, restricted stock, performance shares and performance\\nunits outstanding under Applied\\u2019s equity compensation plans is presented below:\\nSharesWeighted\\nAverage\\nGrant\\u00a0Date\\nFair ValueWeighted\\nAverage\\nRemaining\\nContractual\\u00a0TermAggregate\\nIntrinsic\\nValue\\n\\u00a0 (In millions, except per share amounts)\\nNon-vested restricted stock units, restricted stock,\\nperformance shares and performance units at October\\u00a027,\\n2019 18 \\u00a0$35.78 \\u00a0 2.1 years$ 985 \\u00a0\\nGranted 6 \\u00a0$53.89 \\u00a0\\nVested ( 8 )$31.25 \\u00a0\\nCanceled ( 1 )$42.61 \\u00a0\\nNon-vested restricted stock units, restricted stock,\\nperformance shares and performance units at October\\u00a025,\\n2020 15 \\u00a0$45.36 \\u00a0 2.2 years$ 914 \\u00a0\\nGranted 5 \\u00a0$92.04 \\u00a0\\nVested ( 6 )$43.11 \\u00a0\\nCanceled ( 1 )$59.41 \\u00a0\\nNon-vested restricted stock units, restricted stock,\\nperformance shares and performance units at October\\u00a031,\\n2021 13 \\u00a0$63.29 \\u00a0 2.2 years$1,752 \\u00a0\\nGranted 4 \\u00a0$132.44 \\u00a0\\nVested ( 5 )$54.00 \\u00a0\\nCanceled ( 1 )$82.54 \\u00a0\\nNon-vested restricted stock units, restricted stock,\\nperformance shares and performance units at October\\u00a030,\\n2022 11 \\u00a0$92.31 \\u00a0 2.2 years$1,024 \\u00a0\\nNon-vested restricted stock units, restricted stock,\\nperformance shares and performance units expected to vest 11 \\u00a0$90.78 \\u00a0 2.0 years$ 997 \\u00a0\\nAt October\\u00a030, 2022, 0.9 million additional Performance-Based Awards could be earned based upon\\nachievement of certain levels of speci\\ufb01ed performance and/or market goals.* 94 Table of Contents\\nAPPLIED MATERIALS, INC.\\nNOTES\\u00a0TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\u2014 (Continued)\\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plans\\nUnder the ESPP, substantially all employees may purchase Applied common stock through payroll deductions\\nat a price equal to 85 percent of the lower of the fair market value of Applied common stock at the beginning or\\nend of each 6 -month purchase period, subject to certain limits.

The Surgery portfolios include advanced and general surgery o\\ufb00erings (Ethicon), solutions that focus on\\nBreast Aesthetics (Mentor), and Ear, Nose and Throat (Acclarent) procedures. Johnson & Johnson Vision products\\ninclude ACUVUE Brand contact lenses and ophthalmic technologies related to cataract and laser refractive surgery.\\nThese products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used predominantly in the professional\\n\\ufb01elds by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics.\\nGeographic Areas\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0Johnson\\u00a0& Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 152,700\\u00a0employees worldwide\\nengaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the healthcare\\n\\ufb01eld. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the primary focus on products\\nrelated to human health and well-being.\\nThe products made and sold in the international business include many of those described above under \\u201c\\u2013\\n\\u00a0Segments of Business\\u00a0\\u2013 Consumer Health,\\u201d \\u201c\\u2013\\u00a0Pharmaceutical\\u201d and \\u201c\\u2013\\u00a0MedTech.\\u201d However, the principal markets,\\nproducts and methods of distribution in the international business vary with the country and the culture. The\\nproducts sold in international business include those developed in the U.S. and by subsidiaries abroad.\\nInvestments and activities in some countries outside the U.S. are subject to higher risks than comparable\\nU.S.\\u00a0activities because the investment and commercial climate may be in\\ufb02uenced by \\ufb01nancial instability in\\ninternational economies, restrictive economic policies and political and legal system uncertainties.\\nRaw Materials\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0Raw materials essential to the Company's business are generally readily available from multiple sources. Where\\nthere are exceptions, the temporary unavailability of those raw materials would not likely have a material adverse\\ne\\ufb00ect on the \\ufb01nancial results of the Company.\\nPatents\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0The Company's subsidiaries have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and processes\\nwhere possible. They own, or are licensed under, a signi\\ufb01cant number of patents in the U.S. and other countries\\nrelating to their products, product uses, formulations and manufacturing processes, which in the aggregate are\\nbelieved to be of material importance to the Company in the operation of its businesses. The Company\\u2019s\\nsubsidiaries face patent challenges from third parties, including challenges seeking to manufacture and market\\ngeneric and biosimilar versions of the Company's key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable\\npatents covering those products. Signi\\ufb01cant legal proceedings and claims involving the Company's patent and\\nother intellectual property are described in Note 19, \\u201cLegal Proceedings\\u2014Intellectual Property\\u201d of the Notes to\\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\nSales of the Company\\u2019s largest product, STELARA (ustekinumab), accounted for approximately 10.2% of the\\nCompany's total revenues for \\ufb01scal 2022. Accordingly, the patents related to this product are believed to be\\nmaterial to the\\n2  Company. Janssen Biotech, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, owns patents speci\\ufb01cally related\\nto STELARA.The latest expiring United States composition of matter patent expires in 2023. The latest expiring\\nEuropean composition of matter patent expires in 2024.\\nSales of the Company\\u2019s second largest product, collectively DARZALEX (daratumumab) and DARZALEX\\nFASPRO (daratumumab and hyaluronidase-\\ufb01hj), accounted for approximately 8.4% of the Company's total revenues\\nfor \\ufb01scal 2022. Accordingly, the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the Company.\\nGenmab A/S owns two patent families related to DARZALEX, and Janssen Biotech, Inc. has an exclusive license to\\nthose patent families. The two patent families both expire in the United States in 2029. The latest expiring licensed\\nEuropean patent expires in 2032. Janssen Biotech, Inc. owns a separate patent portfolio related to DARZALEX\\nFASPRO.\\nTrademarks\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0The Company\\u2019s subsidiaries have made a practice of selling their products under trademarks and of obtaining\\nprotection for these trademarks by all available means. These trademarks are protected by registration in the U.S.\\nand other countries where such products are marketed. The Company considers these trademarks in the aggregate\\nto be of material importance in the operation of its businesses.\\nSeasonality\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0Worldwide sales do not re\\ufb02ect any signi\\ufb01cant degree of seasonality; however, spending has typically been\\nheavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in other quarters. This re\\ufb02ects increased spending decisions,\\nprincipally for advertising and research and development activity.\\nCompetition\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0In all of their product lines, the Company's subsidiaries compete with companies both locally and globally.\\nCompetition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved.\\nCompetition in research, both internally and externally sourced, involving the development and the improvement of\\nnew and existing products and processes, is particularly signi\\ufb01cant. The development of new and innovative\\nproducts, as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the Company\\u2019s product portfolio, is important\\nto the Company's success in all areas of its business. The competitive environment requires substantial\\ninvestments in continuing research. In addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for the\\nCompany\\u2019s consumer products involve signi\\ufb01cant expenditures for advertising and promotion.\\nEnvironment\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0The Company is subject to a variety of U.S.\\u00a0and international environmental protection measures. The Company\\nbelieves that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations. The\\nCompany\\u2019s compliance with these requirements is not expected to have a material e\\ufb00ect upon its capital\\nexpenditures, cash \\ufb02ows, earnings or competitive position.\\nRegulation\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 The Company\\u2019s businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which\\noperations are conducted, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation and enforcement. The\\nCompany is subject to costly and complex U.S. and foreign laws and governmental regulations and any adverse\\nregulatory action may materially adversely a\\ufb00ect the Company's \\ufb01nancial condition and business operations. In the\\nU.S., the drug, device and cosmetic industries have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state\\nagencies, primarily as to product safety, e\\ufb03cacy, manufacturing, advertising, labeling and safety reporting. The\\nexercise of broad regulatory powers by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the U.S. FDA) continues to result in\\nincreases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for U.S. FDA approval of new drugs and devices\\nand a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction. Similar trends are also evident in major\\nmarkets outside of the U.S. The new medical device regulatory framework and the evolving privacy, data\\nlocalization, and emerging cyber security laws and regulations around the world are examples of such increased\\nregulation. Five U.S. States (California, Connecticut, Colorado, Utah and Virginia) now have comprehensive privacy\\nlaws in place and China introduced broad personal information protection and data security regulations in 2022.\\nWith other jurisdictions enacting similar privacy laws, local data protection authorities will force greater\\naccountability on the collection, access and use of personal data in the healthcare industry.\\nThe regulatory agencies under whose purview the Company operates have administrative powers that may\\nsubject it to actions such as product withdrawals, recalls, seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions.\\nIn some cases, the Company\\u2019s subsidiaries may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls regardless of whether\\nit has been required or directed to.\\nThe U.S. FDA and regulatory agencies around the globe are also increasing their enforcement activities. If the U.S.\\nFDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our drugs or\\nmedical \\n3 devices are ine\\ufb00ective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the U.S. FDA could ban such products, detain or seize\\nadulterated or misbranded products, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of such products, refuse to grant\\npending applications for marketing authorization or require certi\\ufb01cates of foreign governments for exports, and/or\\nrequire us to notify health professionals and others that the products present unreasonable risks of substantial\\nharm to the public health. The U.S. FDA may also assess civil or criminal penalties against us, our o\\ufb03cers or\\nemployees and impose operating restrictions on a company-wide basis, or enjoin and/or restrain certain conduct\\nresulting in violations of applicable law. The U.S. FDA may also recommend prosecution to the U.S. Department of\\nJustice. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from e\\ufb00ectively marketing and\\nselling our products and limit our ability to obtain future clearances or approvals, and could result in a substantial\\nmodi\\ufb01cation to our business practices and operations. Equivalent enforcement mechanisms exist in di\\ufb00erent\\ncountries in which we conduct business.\\nThe costs of human healthcare have been and continue to be a subject of study, investigation and\\nregulation by governmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world. In the U.S., attention has been\\nfocused by states, regulatory agencies and Congress on prices, pro\\ufb01ts, overutilization and the quality and costs of\\nhealthcare generally. Laws and regulations have been enacted to require adherence to strict compliance standards\\nand prevent fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. There is increased focus on interactions and \\ufb01nancial\\nrelationships between healthcare companies and healthcare providers. Various transparency laws and regulations\\nrequire disclosures of payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals and,\\nbeginning with disclosures in 2022, to certain non-physician practitioners. Federal and foreign laws governing\\ninternational business practices require strict compliance with anti-bribery standards and certain prohibitions with\\nrespect to payments to any foreign government o\\ufb03cial. Payers and Pharmacy Bene\\ufb01t Managers (PBMs) have\\nbecome a more potent force in the market place and increased attention is being paid to drug pricing and\\nappropriate drug and medical device utilization.\\nOur business has been and continues to be a\\ufb00ected by federal and state legislation that alters the pricing,\\ncoverage, and reimbursement landscape. At the federal level, in August 2022, President Biden signed into law the\\nIn\\ufb02ation Reduction Act (IRA), which includes provisions that e\\ufb00ectively authorize the government to establish prices\\nfor certain high-spend single-source drugs and biologics reimbursed by the Medicare program, starting in 2026 for\\nMedicare Part D drugs and 2028 for Medicare Part B drugs. It is not yet certain which products the federal\\ngovernment will select and subject to government-established prices, or how the federal government will establish\\nprices for selected products, as the IRA speci\\ufb01es a ceiling price but not a minimum price. One or more of our\\nproducts could be selected and subject to the government-established price.\\nThe IRA also contains provisions that impose rebates if certain prices increase at a rate that outpaces the\\nrate of in\\ufb02ation, beginning October 1, 2022, for Medicare Part D drugs and January 1, 2023, for Medicare Part B\\ndrugs. Separate IRA provisions redesign the Medicare Part D bene\\ufb01t in various ways, including by shifting a greater\\nportion of costs to manufacturers within certain coverage phases and replacing the Part D coverage gap discount\\nprogram with a new manufacturer discounting program. Failure to comply with IRA provisions may subject\\nmanufacturers to various penalties, including civil monetary penalties. The impact of the IRA on our business and\\nthe broader pharmaceutical industry remains uncertain, as the federal government has yet to make various IRA\\nimplementation decisions.\\nAdditionally, we expect continued scrutiny on drug pricing and government price reporting from Congress,\\nagencies, and other bodies at the federal and state levels.\\nThere are a number of additional bills pending in Congress and healthcare reform proposals at the state\\nlevel that would a\\ufb00ect drug pricing, including in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This changing legal\\nlandscape has both positive and negative impacts on the U.S. healthcare industry with much remaining uncertain\\nas to how various provisions of federal and state law, and potential modi\\ufb01cation or repeal of these laws, will\\nultimately a\\ufb00ect the industry. The IRA and any other federal or state legislative change could a\\ufb00ect the pricing and\\nmarket conditions for our products.\\nIn addition, business practices in the healthcare industry have come under increased scrutiny, particularly in\\nthe U.S., by government agencies and state attorneys general, and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry\\nthe risk of signi\\ufb01cant civil and criminal penalties. Of note is the increased enforcement activity by data protection\\nauthorities in various jurisdictions, particularly in the European Union, where signi\\ufb01cant \\ufb01nes have been levied on\\ncompanies for data breaches, violations of privacy requirements, and unlawful cross-border data transfers. In the\\nU.S., the Federal Trade Commission has stepped up enforcement of data privacy with several signi\\ufb01cant\\nsettlements and there have been a material increase in class-action lawsuits linked to the collection and use of\\nbiometric data.\\nFurther, the Company relies on global supply chains, and production and distribution processes, that are complex,\\nare subject to increasing regulatory requirements, and may be faced with unexpected changes such as those\\nresulting from the 4 COVID-19 pandemic and Brexit that may a\\ufb00ect sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in the Company's\\nproducts. These processes also are subject to complex and lengthy regulatory approvals.\\nEmployees and Human Capital Management\\nAs of January\\u00a01, 2023, and January\\u00a02, 2022, the number of employees were approximately:\\n2022\\u00a0 2021\\u00a0\\nEmployees 155,800\\u00a0 144,300\\u00a0\\nFull-time equivalent (FTE)\\npositions 152,700\\u00a0 141,700\\u00a0\\n\\u201cEmployee\\u201d is de\\ufb01ned as an individual working full-time or part-time, excluding \\ufb01xed term employees, interns and co-op employees. Employee\\ndata may not include full population from more recently acquired companies and individuals on long-term disability are excluded. Contingent\\nworkers, contractors and subcontractors are also excluded. Abiomed headcount has been included in the above table.\\n FTE represents the total number of full-time equivalent positions and does not re\\ufb02ect the total number of individual employees as some work\\npart-time.\\nStrategy\\nThe Company believes that its employees are critical to its continued success and are an essential element\\nof its long-term strategy. Management is responsible for ensuring that its policies and processes re\\ufb02ect and\\nreinforce the Company's desired corporate culture, including policies and processes related to strategy, risk\\nmanagement, and ethics and compliance. The Company\\u2019s human capital management strategy is built on three\\nfundamental focus areas:\\n\\u2022Attracting and recruiting the best talent\\n\\u2022Developing and retaining talent\\n\\u2022Empowering and inspiring talent\\nUnderpinning these focus areas are ongoing e\\ufb00orts to cultivate and foster a culture built on diversity, equity\\nand inclusion (DEI), innovation, health, well-being and safety, where the Company's employees are encouraged to\\nsucceed both professionally and personally while helping the Company achieve its business goals.\\nCulture and Employee Engagement\\nAt the Company, employees are guided by Our Credo which sets forth the Company's responsibilities to\\npatients, consumers, customers, healthcare professionals, employees, communities and shareholders. Employees\\nworldwide must adhere to the Company\\u2019s Code of Business Conduct which sets basic requirements and serves as a\\nfoundation for the Company policies, procedures and guidelines, all of which provide additional guidance on\\nexpected employee behaviors in every market where it operates. The Company conducts global surveys that o\\ufb00er\\nits employees the ability to provide feedback and valuable insight to help address potential human resources risks\\nand identify opportunities to improve. In 2022, 92% of global employees across 77 countries participated in Our\\nCredo Survey which was o\\ufb00ered in 36 languages.1\\n2\\n1\\n2 5 Growth and Development\\nTo continue to lead in the changing healthcare landscape, it is crucial that the Company continue to attract\\nand retain top talent. The Company believes that its employees must be equipped with the right knowledge and\\nskills and be provided with opportunities to grow and develop in their careers. Accordingly, professional\\ndevelopment programs and educational resources\\nare available to all employees. The Company's objective is to foster a learning culture that helps shape each\\nperson\\u2019s unique career path while creating a robust pipeline of talent to deliver on the Company\\u2019s long-term\\nstrategies. In furtherance of this objective, the Company deploys a global approach to ensure development is for\\neveryone, regardless of where they are on their career journey. In 2022, 46.2% of employees in Manager and above\\njob categories who had movements (including upward promotions or lateral transfers) took advantage of career\\nopportunities by moving across functions, country or business segment lines (excluding employees in the research\\nand development organizations). The Company's voluntary turnover rate was 9%.\\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)\\nThe Company is committed to workplace diversity and to cultivating, fostering, and advancing a culture of\\nequity and inclusion. In 2022, Johnson & Johnson introduced the Company\\u2019s evolved enterprise Diversity, Equity\\nand Inclusion strategy, which recognizes how DEI accelerates the Company\\u2019s ability to meet the changing needs of\\nthe communities the Company serves to deliver Our Purpose to profoundly change the trajectory of health for\\nhumanity. The Company\\u2019s DEI vision is: Be yourself, change the world. The Company\\u2019s DEI Mission is: Make\\ndiversity, equity and inclusion how we work everyday. Our evolved enterprise DEI Strategy is aligned to our DEI\\nVision and Mission and rests on four core pillars:\\n\\u2022Accelerate our global culture of inclusion where every individual belongs\\n\\u2022Build a workforce that re\\ufb02ects the diversity of our communities\\n\\u2022Transform talent and business processes to achieve equitable access and outcomes for all\\n\\u2022Drive innovation and growth with our business to serve diverse markets around the world\\nThe Company\\u2019s DEI strategy is guided by internal and external insights, global best practices and continual\\nemployee feedback which remind the Company that while diversity changes by location, inclusion is the same\\neverywhere.\\nCompensation and Bene\\ufb01ts\\nAs part of the Company's total rewards philosophy, the Company o\\ufb00ers competitive compensation and\\nbene\\ufb01ts to attract and retain top talent. The Company is committed to fairness and equitable treatment in its\\ncompensation and bene\\ufb01ts for employees at all levels. The Company observes legal minimum wage provisions and\\nexceeds them where possible. The Company's total rewards o\\ufb00erings include an array of programs to support its\\nemployees' well-being, including annual performance incentive opportunities, pension and retirement savings\\nprograms, health and welfare bene\\ufb01ts, paid time o\\ufb00, leave programs, \\ufb02exible work schedules and employee\\nassistance programs. In recognition of the Company\\u2019s commitment to help employees balance their personal and\\nprofessional responsibilities, the Company extended its paid parental leave bene\\ufb01t globally from 8 to 12 weeks for\\nall eligible employees. In the U.S., the bene\\ufb01t was e\\ufb00ective on January 1, 2022, with retroactive coverage for new\\nfamily additions as of July 1, 2021.\\nHealth, Wellness and Safety\\nThe Company\\u2019s investment in employee health, well-being and safety is built on its conviction that\\nadvancing health for humanity starts with advancing the health of its employees. With the right awareness, focus,\\npractices and tools, the Company ensures that all its employees around the world, as well as temporary contractors\\nand visitors to the Company's sites, can work safely. The Company has continuously expanded health and well-\\nbeing programs throughout the Company and across the globe, incorporating new thinking and technologies to\\nkeep its o\\ufb00erings best-in-class and to help employees achieve their personal health goals. The programs and\\npractices the Company advances for total health\\u2014physical, mental, emotional and \\ufb01nancial\\u2014ensure employee\\nhealth protection for emerging health risks. Protecting and supporting our employees as the COVID-19 pandemic\\nhas evolved continues to be a top priority and the Company\\u2019s approach includes: ensuring the health and safety of\\nour employees in the workplace through robust layers of protection; enhanced cleaning and access to cleaning\\nsupplies and personal protective equipment; supporting employees with bene\\ufb01ts and well-being tools. The\\nCompany continues to address our employees needs through J&J Flex, a hybrid model that empowers the\\nCompany\\u2019s o\\ufb03ce-based employees to \\ufb01nd the right productivity and balance of in-person and remote work.\\n6 Available Information\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0The Company\\u2019s main corporate website address is www.jnj.com.

The\\nCompany seeks to identify, manage and mitigate risks to our business, but uncertainties and risks are di\\ufb03cult to\\npredict and many are outside of the Company\\u2019s control and cannot therefore be eliminated. In addition to the other\\ninformation in this report and the Company\\u2019s other \\ufb01lings with the SEC, investors should consider carefully the\\nfactors set forth below. Investors should be aware that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and\\nthat the following is not meant to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. If known or\\nunknown risks or uncertainties materialize, the Company\\u2019s business, results of operations or \\ufb01nancial condition\\ncould be adversely a\\ufb00ected, potentially in a material way.\\nRisks Related to Our Business, Industry and Operations\\nThe Company\\u2019s businesses operate in highly competitive product markets and competitive pressures\\ncould adversely a\\ufb00ect the Company\\u2019s earnings.\\nThe Company faces substantial competition in all three operating segments and in all geographic markets. The\\nCompany\\u2019s businesses compete with companies of all sizes on the basis of cost-e\\ufb00ectiveness, technological\\ninnovations, intellectual property rights, product performance, real or perceived product advantages, pricing and\\navailability and rate of reimbursement. The Company also competes with other market participants in securing\\nrights to acquisitions, collaborations and licensing agreements with third parties. Competition for rights to product\\ncandidates and technologies may result in signi\\ufb01cant investment and acquisition costs and onerous agreement\\nterms for the Company. Competitors\\u2019 development of more e\\ufb00ective or less costly products, and/or their ability to\\nsecure patent and other intellectual property rights and successfully market products ahead of the Company, could\\nnegatively impact sales of the Company\\u2019s existing products as well as its ability to bring new products to market\\ndespite signi\\ufb01cant prior investment in the related product development.\\nFor the Company\\u2019s Pharmaceutical businesses, loss of patent exclusivity for a product often is followed by a\\nsubstantial reduction in sales as competitors gain regulatory approval for generic and other competing products\\nand enter the market. Similar competition can be triggered by the loss of exclusivity for a biological product. For\\nthe Company\\u2019s MedTech businesses, technological innovation, product quality, reputation and customer service are\\nespecially important to competitiveness. Development by other companies of new or improved products, processes\\nand technologies could threaten to make the Company\\u2019s products or technologies less desirable, less economical or\\nobsolete. The Company\\u2019s Consumer Health businesses face intense competition from other branded products and\\nretailers\\u2019 private-label brands. If the Company fails to su\\ufb03ciently di\\ufb00erentiate and market its brand name\\nconsumer products, this could adversely a\\ufb00ect revenues and pro\\ufb01tability of those products.\\nInterruptions and delays in manufacturing operations could adversely a\\ufb00ect the Company\\u2019s business,\\nsales and reputation.\\nThe Company\\u2019s manufacture of products requires the timely delivery of su\\ufb03cient amounts of complex, high-quality\\ncomponents and materials. The Company\\u2019s subsidiaries operate 89 manufacturing facilities as well as sourcing\\nfrom thousands of suppliers around the world. The Company has in the past, and may in the future, face\\nunanticipated interruptions and delays in manufacturing through its internal or external supply chain.\\nManufacturing disruptions can occur for many reasons including regulatory action, production quality deviations or\\nsafety issues, labor disputes, labor shortages, site-speci\\ufb01c incidents (such as \\ufb01res), natural disasters such as\\nhurricanes and other severe weather events, raw material shortages, political unrest, terrorist attacks and\\nepidemics or pandemics. Such delays and di\\ufb03culties in manufacturing can result in product shortages, declines in\\nsales and reputational impact as well as signi\\ufb01cant remediation and related costs associated with addressing the\\nshortage.\\nThe Company relies on third parties to manufacture certain of our products. Any failure by or loss of a\\nthird-party manufacturer could result in delays and increased costs, which may adversely a\\ufb00ect our\\nbusiness.\\nThe Company relies on third parties to manufacture certain of our products. We depend on these third-party\\nmanufacturers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity su\\ufb03cient to meet our needs, to produce\\nproducts of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a\\ntimely basis and at acceptable prices. However, we cannot guarantee that these third-party manufacturers will be\\nable to meet our near-term or long-term manufacturing requirements, which could result in lost sales and have an\\nadverse e\\ufb00ect on our business.\\nOther risks associated with our reliance on third parties to manufacture these products include reliance on the third\\nparty for regulatory compliance and quality assurance, misappropriation of the Company\\u2019s intellectual property,\\nlimited ability to manage our inventory, possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party and the\\npossible termination or nonrenewal of the manufacturing agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or\\ninconvenient for us. Moreover, if any of our third-party manufacturers su\\ufb00ers any damage to facilities, loses\\nbene\\ufb01ts under material agreements, experiences power outages, encounters \\ufb01nancial di\\ufb03culties, is unable to secure necessary raw materials from its suppliers or su\\ufb00ers any other reduction in e\\ufb03ciency, the Company may\\nexperience signi\\ufb01cant business disruption. In the event of any such disruption, the\\n8 Company would need to seek and source other quali\\ufb01ed third-party manufacturers, likely resulting in further delays\\nand increased costs which could a\\ufb00ect our business adversely.\\nCounterfeit versions of our products could harm our patients and have a negative impact on our\\nrevenues, earnings, reputation and business.\\nOur industry continues to be challenged by the vulnerability of distribution channels to illegal counterfeiting and\\nthe presence of counterfeit products in a growing number of markets and over the Internet. Third parties may\\nillegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of our products, which do not meet our rigorous manufacturing and\\ntesting standards. To distributors and patients, counterfeit products may be visually indistinguishable from the\\nauthentic version. Counterfeit medicines pose a risk to patient health and safety because of the conditions under\\nwhich they are manufactured \\u2013 often in unregulated, unlicensed, uninspected and unsanitary sites \\u2013 as well as the\\nlack of regulation of their contents.\\nThe industry\\u2019s failure to mitigate the threat of counterfeit medicines could adversely impact our business and\\nreputation by impacting patient con\\ufb01dence in our authentic products, potentially resulting in lost sales, product\\nrecalls, and an increased threat of litigation. In addition, diversion of our products from their authorized market into\\nother channels may result in reduced revenues and negatively a\\ufb00ect our pro\\ufb01tability.\\nGlobal health crises, pandemics, epidemics, or other outbreaks could adversely disrupt or impact\\ncertain aspects of the Company\\u2019s business, results of operations and \\ufb01nancial condition.\\nWe are subject to risks associated with global health crises, epidemics, pandemics and other outbreaks (such\\nincident(s), a health crisis or health crises), including the global outbreak of coronavirus and its variants (COVID-\\n19). The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, certain aspects of\\nthe Company\\u2019s business, results of operations and \\ufb01nancial condition, including lower sales and reduced customer\\ndemand and usage of certain of our products. The continued spread of COVID-19 or other health crises may cause\\nthe Company to modify its business practices, and take further actions as may be required by government\\nauthorities or as the Company determines are in the best interests of our patients, customers, employees and\\nbusiness partners. While the Company has robust business continuity plans in place across our global supply chain\\nnetwork to help mitigate the impact of health crises, these e\\ufb00orts may not completely prevent our business from\\nbeing adversely a\\ufb00ected and future impacts remain uncertain.\\nWhile the U.S. and other countries have substantially reopened their economies, the extent to which COVID-19, or\\nother health crises, could impact the Company\\u2019s future operations will depend on many factors which cannot be\\npredicted with con\\ufb01dence, including the duration of an outbreak and impact of variants. A surge in COVID-19 or\\nother health crises could result in the imposition of new mandates and prolonged restrictive measures\\nimplemented in order to control the spread of disease. The global spread of COVID-19 or other health crises could\\nadversely impact the Company\\u2019s operations, including, among other things, our manufacturing operations, supply\\nchain, third-party suppliers, sales and marketing, and clinical trial operations. Any of these factors could adversely\\na\\ufb00ect the Company\\u2019s business, \\ufb01nancial results, and global economic conditions generally.\\nWe also face uncertainties related to our vaccine development programs, including uncertainties related to the risk\\nthat our continued development programs may not be successful, commercially viable or receive approval from\\nregulatory authorities; risks associated with clinical trial and real-world data, including further analyses of its\\ne\\ufb03cacy, safety and durability; the risk that continued evolution and mutation of disease and the duration of a\\nparticular outbreak may impede our ability to conduct trials within a speci\\ufb01ed time frame; the risk that data are\\nsubject to di\\ufb00ering interpretations and assessments, including during the peer review/publication process, in the\\nscienti\\ufb01c community generally, and by national immunization technical advisory groups (NITAGs) and regulatory\\nauthorities; disruptions in the relationships between us, our third-party suppliers, external manufacturers, and other\\nthird parties with whom we engage; the risk that other companies may produce superior or competitive products;\\nthe risk that demand for any products we may develop may no longer exist; risks related to the availability of raw\\nmaterials to manufacture any such products; the risk that we may not be able to recoup costs associated with our\\nR&D and manufacturing e\\ufb00orts and risks associated with any changes in the way we approach or provide additional\\nresearch funding for potential drug development; the risk that we may not be able to create or scale up\\nmanufacturing capacity on a timely basis, that we may continue to experience manufacturing delays once a\\nmanufacturing site is activated, or have access to logistics or supply channels commensurate with global demand\\nfor any potential approved vaccine or product candidate, which would negatively impact our ability to supply the\\nestimated numbers of doses of our vaccine within the projected time periods indicated, and other challenges and\\nrisks associated with the pace of our vaccine development program; and pricing and access challenges for such\\nproducts, including in the U.S.\\nRisks Related to Government Regulation and Legal Proceedings\\nGlobal sales in the Company\\u2019s Pharmaceutical and MedTech segments may be negatively impacted by\\nhealthcare reforms and increasing pricing pressures.\\n9  Sales of the Company\\u2019s Pharmaceutical and MedTech products are signi\\ufb01cantly a\\ufb00ected by reimbursements by\\nthird-party payers such as government healthcare programs, private insurance plans and managed care\\norganizations. As part of various e\\ufb00orts to contain healthcare costs, these payers are putting downward pressure\\non prices at which products will be reimbursed. In the U.S., increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on\\nbehalf of Medicare, Medicaid, and private sector bene\\ufb01ciaries, in part due to continued consolidation among\\nhealthcare providers, could result in further pricing pressures. In addition, recent legislation and ongoing political\\nscrutiny or pricing, coverage and reimbursement could result in additional pricing pressures. Speci\\ufb01cally, the\\nIn\\ufb02ation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) may subject certain products to government-established pricing, potentially\\nimpose rebates, and subject manufacturers who fail to adhere to the government's interpretations of the law to\\npenalties. Outside the U.S., numerous major markets, including the EU, United Kingdom, Japan and China, have\\npervasive government involvement in funding healthcare and, in that regard, directly or indirectly impose price\\ncontrols, limit access to, or reimbursement for, the Company\\u2019s products, or reduce the value of its intellectual\\nproperty protection.\\nThe Company is subject to signi\\ufb01cant legal proceedings that can result in signi\\ufb01cant expenses, \\ufb01nes\\nand reputational damage.\\nIn the ordinary course of business, Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims and\\nlawsuits involving various issues such as product liability, patent disputes and claims that their product sales,\\nmarketing and pricing practices violate various antitrust, unfair trade practices and/or consumer protection laws.\\nThe Company\\u2019s more signi\\ufb01cant legal proceedings are described in Note 19, \\u201cLegal Proceedings\\u201d under Notes to\\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Litigation, in general, and securities,\\nderivative action, class action and multi-district litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Some of\\nthese matters may include thousands of plainti\\ufb00s, may involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate\\namounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years. For example,\\nthe Company is a defendant in numerous lawsuits arising out of the use of body powders containing talc, primarily\\nJOHNSON\\u2019S Baby Powder, and the Company\\u2019s sale, manufacturing and marketing of opioids. While the Company\\nbelieves it has substantial defenses in these matters, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation.\\nThe Company could in the future be required to pay signi\\ufb01cant amounts as a result of settlements or judgments in\\nthese matters, potentially in excess of accruals, including matters where the Company could be held jointly and\\nseverally liable among other defendants. The resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters\\nin any reporting period could have a material adverse e\\ufb00ect on the Company\\u2019s results of operations and cash \\ufb02ows\\nfor that period. The Company does not purchase third-party product liability insurance; however, the Company\\nutilizes a wholly owned captive insurance company subject to certain limits.\\nProduct reliability, safety and e\\ufb00ectiveness concerns can have signi\\ufb01cant negative impacts on sales\\nand results of operations, lead to litigation and cause reputational damage.\\nConcerns about product safety, whether raised internally or by litigants, regulators or consumer advocates, and\\nwhether or not based on scienti\\ufb01c evidence, can result in safety alerts, product recalls, governmental\\ninvestigations, regulatory action on the part of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (or its counterpart in other\\ncountries), private claims and lawsuits, payment of \\ufb01nes and settlements, declining sales and reputational damage.\\nThese circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in the Company\\u2019s\\nproducts. Product recalls have in the past, and could in the future, prompt government investigations and\\ninspections, the shutdown of manufacturing facilities, continued product shortages and related sales declines,\\nsigni\\ufb01cant remediation costs, reputational damage, possible civil penalties and criminal prosecution.\\nThe Company faces signi\\ufb01cant regulatory scrutiny, which imposes signi\\ufb01cant compliance costs and\\nexposes the Company to government investigations, legal actions and penalties.\\nLike other companies in the healthcare industry, the Company is subject to extensive regulation, investigations and\\nlegal action by national, state and local government agencies in the U.S. and other countries in which it operates.\\nRegulatory issues regarding compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) (and comparable quality\\nregulations in foreign countries) by manufacturers of drugs, devices and consumer products can lead to \\ufb01nes and\\npenalties, product recalls, product shortages, interruptions in production, delays in new product approvals and\\nlitigation. In addition, the marketing, pricing and sale of the Company\\u2019s products are subject to regulation,\\ninvestigations and legal actions including under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Medicaid Rebate\\nProgram, federal and state false claims acts, state unfair trade practices acts and consumer protection laws.\\nScrutiny of healthcare industry business practices by government agencies and state attorneys general in the U.S.,\\nand any resulting investigations and prosecutions, carry risk of signi\\ufb01cant civil and criminal penalties including, but\\nnot limited to, debarment from participation in government healthcare programs. Any such debarment could have\\na material adverse e\\ufb00ect on the Company\\u2019s business and results of operations. The most signi\\ufb01cant current\\ninvestigations and litigation brought by government agencies are described in Note 19, \\u201cLegal Proceedings\\u2014\\nGovernment Proceedings\\u201d under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\\nChanges in tax laws or exposures to additional tax liabilities could negatively impact the Company\\u2019s\\noperating results.\\nChanges in tax laws or regulations around the world, including in the U.S. and as led by the Organization for\\nEconomic Cooperation and Development, such as the recent adoption by the EU, enactment by South Korea and the anticipated enactment\\n10 by additional countries of a global minimum tax, could negatively impact the Company\\u2019s e\\ufb00ective tax rate and\\nresults of operations. A change in statutory tax rate or certain international tax provisions in any country would\\nresult in the revaluation of the Company\\u2019s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in\\nthe period in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or bene\\ufb01t recorded to the\\nCompany\\u2019s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the\\ncountries where it operates. Changes to tax laws or regulations may occur at any time, and any related expense or\\nbene\\ufb01t recorded may be material to the \\ufb01scal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted.\\nSee Note 8, \\u201cIncome Taxes\\u201d under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report\\nfor additional information.\\nThe Company conducts business and \\ufb01les tax returns in numerous countries and is addressing tax audits and\\ndisputes with many tax authorities. In connection with various government initiatives, companies are required to\\ndisclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit\\nscrutiny of pro\\ufb01ts earned in other countries. The Company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of its tax audits\\nand disputes to determine the appropriateness of its tax reserves. However, any tax authority could take a position\\non tax treatment that is contrary to the Company\\u2019s expectations, which could result in tax liabilities in excess of\\nreserves.\\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\\nThe Company faces increased challenges to intellectual property rights central to its business.\\nThe Company owns or licenses a signi\\ufb01cant number of patents and other proprietary rights relating to its products\\nand manufacturing processes. These rights are essential to the Company\\u2019s businesses and materially important to\\nthe Company\\u2019s results of operations. Public policy, both within and outside the U.S., has become increasingly\\nunfavorable toward intellectual property rights. The Company cannot be certain that it will obtain adequate patent\\nprotection for new products and technologies in the United States and other important markets or that such\\nprotections, once granted, will last as long as originally anticipated.\\nCompetitors routinely challenge the validity or extent of the Company\\u2019s owned or licensed patents and proprietary\\nrights through litigation, interferences, oppositions and other proceedings, such as inter partes review (IPR)\\nproceedings before the United States Patent & Trademark O\\ufb03ce (USPTO). These proceedings absorb resources and\\ncan be protracted as well as unpredictable. In addition, challenges that the Company\\u2019s products infringe the\\npatents of third parties could result in an injunction and/or the need to pay past damages and future royalties and\\nadversely a\\ufb00ect the competitive position and sales of the products in question.\\nThe Company has faced increasing patent challenges from third parties seeking to manufacture and market generic\\nand biosimilar versions of the Company\\u2019s key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents\\ncovering those products. In the U.S., manufacturers of generic versions of innovative human pharmaceutical\\nproducts may challenge the validity, or claim non-infringement, of innovator products through the Abbreviated New\\nDrug Application, or ANDA, process with the U.S. FDA and related ANDA litigation. The Biologics Price Competition\\nand Innovation Act (BPCIA), enacted in 2010, which created a new regulatory pathway for the approval by the U.S.\\nFDA of biosimilar alternatives to innovator-developed biological products, also created mechanisms for biosimilar\\napplicants to challenge the patents on the innovator biologics. The IPR process with the USPTO is also being used\\nby competitors to challenge patents asserted in litigation.\\nIn the event the Company is not successful in defending its patents against such challenges, or upon the \\u201cat-risk\\u201d\\nlaunch by the generic or biosimilar \\ufb01rm of its product, the Company can lose a major portion of revenues for the\\nreferenced product in a very short period of time. Current legal proceedings involving the Company\\u2019s patents and\\nother intellectual property rights are described in Note 19, \\u201cLegal Proceedings\\u2014Intellectual Property\\u201d under Notes\\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\\nRisks Related to Product Development, Regulatory Approval and Commercialization\\nSigni\\ufb01cant challenges or delays in the Company\\u2019s innovation and development of new products,\\ntechnologies and indications could have an adverse impact on the Company\\u2019s long-term success.\\nThe Company\\u2019s continued growth and success depends on its ability to innovate and develop new and\\ndi\\ufb00erentiated products and services that address the evolving healthcare needs of patients, providers and\\nconsumers. Development of successful products and technologies is also necessary to o\\ufb00set revenue losses when\\nthe Company\\u2019s existing products lose market share due to various factors such as competition and loss of patent\\nexclusivity. New products introduced within the past \\ufb01ve years\\n11 accounted for approximately 25% of 2022 sales. The Company cannot be certain when or whether it will be able to\\ndevelop, license or otherwise acquire companies, products and technologies, whether particular product candidates\\nwill be granted regulatory approval, and, if approved, whether the products will be commercially successful.\\nThe Company pursues product development through internal research and development as well as through\\ncollaborations, acquisitions, joint ventures and licensing or other arrangements with third parties. In all of these\\ncontexts, developing new products, particularly pharmaceutical and biotechnology products and medical devices,\\nrequires signi\\ufb01cant investment of resources over many years. Only a very few biopharmaceutical research and\\ndevelopment programs result in commercially viable products. The process depends on many factors including the\\nability to: discern patients\\u2019 and healthcare providers\\u2019 future needs; develop promising new compounds, strategies\\nand technologies; achieve successful clinical trial results; secure e\\ufb00ective intellectual property protection; obtain\\nregulatory approvals on a timely basis; and, if and when they reach the market, successfully di\\ufb00erentiate the\\nCompany\\u2019s products from competing products and approaches to treatment. New products or enhancements to\\nexisting products may not be accepted quickly or signi\\ufb01cantly in the marketplace due to product and price\\ncompetition, changes in customer preferences or healthcare purchasing patterns, resistance by healthcare\\nproviders or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. Even following initial regulatory approval, the success of a\\nproduct can be adversely impacted by safety and e\\ufb03cacy \\ufb01ndings in larger real-world patient populations, as well\\nas market entry of competitive products.\\nRisks Related to Financial and Economic Market Conditions\\nThe Company faces a variety of \\ufb01nancial, economic, legal, social and political risks associated with\\nconducting business internationally.\\nThe Company\\u2019s extensive operations and business activity throughout the world are accompanied by certain\\n\\ufb01nancial, economic, legal, social and political risks, including those listed below.\\nForeign Currency Exchange: In \\ufb01scal 2022, approximately 49% of the Company\\u2019s sales occurred outside of the U.S.,\\nwith approximately 25% in Europe, 6% in the Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S., and 18% in the Asia-Paci\\ufb01c\\nand Africa region. Changes in non-U.S. currencies relative to the U.S. dollar impact the Company\\u2019s revenues and\\nexpenses. While the Company uses \\ufb01nancial instruments to mitigate the impact of \\ufb02uctuations in currency\\nexchange rates on its cash \\ufb02ows, unhedged exposures continue to be subject to currency \\ufb02uctuations. In addition,\\nthe weakening or strengthening of the U.S. dollar may result in signi\\ufb01cant favorable or unfavorable translation\\ne\\ufb00ects when the operating results of the Company\\u2019s non-U.S. business activity are translated into U.S. dollars.\\nIn\\ufb02ation and Currency Devaluation Risks: The Company faces challenges in maintaining pro\\ufb01tability of operations\\nin economies experiencing high in\\ufb02ation rates. Speci\\ufb01cally, the Company has accounted for operations in\\nArgentina, Turkey and Venezuela as highly in\\ufb02ationary, as the prior three-year cumulative in\\ufb02ation rate surpassed\\n100%. While the Company strives to maintain pro\\ufb01t margins in these areas through cost reduction programs,\\nproductivity improvements and periodic price increases, it might experience operating losses as a result of\\ncontinued in\\ufb02ation. In addition, the impact of currency devaluations in countries experiencing high in\\ufb02ation rates or\\nsigni\\ufb01cant currency exchange \\ufb02uctuations could negatively impact the Company\\u2019s operating results.\\nIllegal Importation of Pharmaceutical Products: The illegal importation of pharmaceutical products from countries\\nwhere government price controls or other market dynamics result in lower prices may adversely a\\ufb00ect the\\nCompany\\u2019s sales and pro\\ufb01tability in the U.S. and other countries in which the Company operates. With the\\nexception of limited quantities of prescription drugs for personal use, foreign imports of pharmaceutical products\\nare illegal under current U.S. law. However, the volume of illegal imports continues to rise as the ability of patients\\nand other customers to obtain the lower-priced imports has grown signi\\ufb01cantly.\\nAnti-Bribery and Other Regulations: The Company is subject to various federal and foreign laws that govern its\\ninternational business practices with respect to payments to government o\\ufb03cials. Those laws include the U.S.\\nForeign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits U.S. publicly traded companies from promising, o\\ufb00ering, or\\ngiving anything of value to foreign o\\ufb03cials with the corrupt intent of in\\ufb02uencing the foreign o\\ufb03cial for the purpose\\nof helping the Company obtain or retain business or gain any improper advantage. The Company\\u2019s business is\\nheavily regulated and therefore involves signi\\ufb01cant interaction with foreign o\\ufb03cials. Also, in many countries outside\\nthe U.S., the healthcare providers who prescribe human pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and the\\npurchasers of human pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, the Company\\u2019s interactions with these\\nprescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the FCPA. In addition to the U.S. application and\\nenforcement of the FCPA, various jurisdictions in which the Company operates have laws\\n12 and regulations, including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt and\\nanticompetitive behavior. Enforcement activities under these laws could subject the Company to additional\\nadministrative and legal proceedings and actions, which could include claims for civil penalties, criminal sanctions,\\nand administrative remedies, including exclusion from healthcare programs.\\nOther Financial, Economic, Legal, Social and Political Risks. Other risks inherent in conducting business globally\\ninclude:\\n\\u2022local and regional economic environments and policies in the markets that we serve, including interest\\nrates, monetary policy, in\\ufb02ation, economic growth, recession, commodity prices, and currency controls or\\nother limitations on the ability to expatriate cash;\\n\\u2022protective economic policies taken by governments, such as trade protection measures and import/export\\nlicensing requirements;\\n\\u2022compliance with local regulations and laws including, in some countries, regulatory requirements restricting\\nthe Company\\u2019s ability to manufacture or sell its products in the relevant market;\\n\\u2022diminished protection of intellectual property and contractual rights in certain jurisdictions;\\n\\u2022potential nationalization or expropriation of the Company\\u2019s foreign assets;\\n\\u2022political or social upheavals, economic instability, repression, or human rights issues; and\\n\\u2022geopolitical events, including natural disasters, disruptions to markets due to war, armed con\\ufb02ict, terrorism,\\nepidemics or pandemics.\\nFailure to maintain a satisfactory credit rating could adversely a\\ufb00ect our liquidity, capital position,\\nborrowing costs and access to capital markets.\\nWe currently maintain investment grade credit ratings with Moody\\u2019s Investors Service and Standard & Poor\\u2019s\\nRatings Services. Rating agencies routinely evaluate us, and their ratings of our long-term and short-term debt are\\nbased on a number of factors. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency, whether as a result of\\nour actions or factors which are beyond our control, can increase the cost of borrowing under any indebtedness we\\nmay incur, reduce market capacity for our commercial paper or require the posting of additional collateral under\\nour derivative contracts. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings, and any\\nadditional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our\\nratings are under review for a downgrade, may have a negative impact on our liquidity, capital position and access\\nto capital markets.\\nThe Russia-Ukraine War, and actions taken in response to the Russia-Ukraine War, could adversely\\na\\ufb00ect our business, results of operations or \\ufb01nancial condition.\\nIn February 2022, Russia launched a military invasion of Ukraine. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine War has provoked\\nstrong reactions from the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and various other countries and\\neconomic and political organizations around the world. We have been monitoring the geopolitical situation in Russia\\nsince the start of the Russia-Ukraine War and have suspended additional investment, enrollment of clinical trials,\\nand supply of our personal care products in Russia. We continue to monitor the need for humanitarian relief in the\\nregion and continue to supply our medicines, medical devices and equipment in the region in compliance with the\\napplicable sanctions. We will continue to monitor the geopolitical situation in Russia and to evaluate our activities\\nand future operations in Russia.\\nActions taken in response to the Russia-Ukraine War include the imposition of export controls and broad \\ufb01nancial\\nand economic sanctions against Russia, Belarus and speci\\ufb01c areas of Ukraine. Additional sanctions or other\\nmeasures may be imposed by the global community, including but not limited to limitations on our ability to \\ufb01le,\\nprosecute and maintain patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights. Furthermore, the Russian\\ngovernment has already taken action allowing Russian companies and individuals to exploit inventions owned by\\npatent holders from the United States and many other countries without consent or compensation and we may not\\nbe able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in Russia or from selling or importing products in and\\ninto Russia.\\nWe have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, other risks related to the broad economic\\nconsequences of the Russia-Ukraine War, including foreign currency volatility, decreased demand for our products\\nin countries a\\ufb00ected by the Russia-Ukraine War and challenges to our global supply chain related to increased costs\\nof materials and other inputs for our products and suppliers operating in Russia and Ukraine. We also continue to\\nmonitor the various sanctions and export controls imposed in response to the Russia-Ukraine War.\\nThe full impact of the Russia-Ukraine War, and actions taken in response to the ongoing con\\ufb02ict, on the global\\neconomy and geopolitical relations, in general, and on our business in particular, remain uncertain. Any or all of the\\nforegoing risks could\\n13  have an adverse e\\ufb00ect on our business, results of operations or \\ufb01nancial condition, particularly as the con\\ufb02ict\\ncontinues for an inde\\ufb01nite period of time. Given that developments concerning the Russia-Ukraine War are ongoing\\nand have been constantly evolving, additional impacts and risks may arise that are not presently known to us. The\\nRussia-Ukraine War may also have the e\\ufb00ect of heightening many of the other risks described in this \\u201cRisk Factors\\u201d\\nsection.\\nRisks Related to the Planned Separation of our Consumer Health Business\\nThe planned separation of the Company\\u2019s Consumer Health business may not be completed on the\\nterms or timeline currently contemplated, if at all, and may not achieve the expected results.\\nIn November 2021, the Company announced its intention to separate the Company\\u2019s Consumer Health business,\\nwith the intention to create a standalone publicly traded company, which was subsequently named Kenvue, Inc.\\n(\\\"Kenvue\\\"). The planned separation is intended to qualify as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax\\npurposes. The Company is targeting completion of the planned separation in 2023. Completion of the planned\\nseparation will be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including, among others, consultations with\\nworks councils and other employee representative bodies, as required, \\ufb01nal approval by the Company\\u2019s Board of\\nDirectors, the continuing e\\ufb00ectiveness and validity of the Company's private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue\\nService (\\u201cIRS\\u201d) and receipt of favorable opinions of the Company's U.S. tax advisors with respect to the tax-free\\nnature of the transaction, and the receipt of other regulatory approvals. There can be no assurance regarding the\\nultimate timing of the planned separation or that such separation will be completed. Unanticipated developments\\ncould delay, prevent or otherwise adversely a\\ufb00ect the planned separation, including but not limited to disruptions\\nin general or \\ufb01nancial market conditions or potential problems or delays in obtaining various regulatory and tax\\napprovals or clearances.\\nThe costs to complete the planned separation will be signi\\ufb01cant. In addition, the Company may be\\nunable to achieve some or all of the strategic and \\ufb01nancial bene\\ufb01ts that it expects to achieve from\\nthe planned separation of the Company\\u2019s Consumer Health business.\\nThe Company has incurred, and is expected to incur, signi\\ufb01cant expenses in connection with the planned\\nseparation. In addition, the Company may not be able to achieve the full strategic and \\ufb01nancial bene\\ufb01ts that are\\nexpected to result from the planned separation. The anticipated bene\\ufb01ts of the planned separation are based on a\\nnumber of assumptions, some of which may prove incorrect.\\nFollowing the planned separation, the price of shares of the Company\\u2019s common stock may \\ufb02uctuate\\nsigni\\ufb01cantly.\\nThe Company cannot predict the e\\ufb00ect of the planned separation on the trading price of shares of its common\\nstock, and the market value of shares of its common stock may be less than, equal to or greater than the market\\nvalue of shares of its common stock prior to the planned separation. In addition, the price of the Company\\u2019s\\ncommon stock may be more volatile around the time of the planned separation.\\nThe planned separation could result in substantial tax liability.\\nThe Company has received a private letter ruling from the IRS as to the tax-free nature of the planned separation\\nunder the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The planned separation is conditioned on, among\\nother things, the continuing e\\ufb00ectiveness and validity of the Company's private letter ruling from the IRS and\\nreceipt of favorable opinions of the Company's U.S. tax advisors. The private letter ruling and opinions will be\\nbased on, among other things, various facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from the Company\\nand Kenvue regarding the past and future conduct of the companies\\u2019 respective businesses and other matters. If\\nany of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are incorrect or not otherwise satis\\ufb01ed, the\\nCompany and its shareholders may not be able to rely on the ruling or the opinions of tax advisors.\\nNotwithstanding the private letter ruling and opinions of tax advisors, if subsequent to the planned separation the\\nIRS determines that certain steps of the transaction do not qualify for tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax\\npurposes, the resulting tax liability to the Company and its shareholders could be substantial. The planned\\nseparation may also not qualify for tax-free treatment in other countries around the world, and as a result may\\ntrigger substantial tax liability to the Company.\\nOther Risks\\nOur business depends on our ability to recruit and retain talented, highly skilled employees and a\\ndiverse workforce.\\nOur continued growth requires us to recruit and retain talented employees representing diverse backgrounds,\\nexperiences, and skill sets. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely\\ncompetitive and our ability to compete depends on our ability to hire, develop and motivate highly skilled\\npersonnel in all areas of our organization. Maintaining our brand and reputation, as well as a diverse, equitable and\\ninclusive work environment enables us to attract top talent. If we are less successful in our recruiting e\\ufb00orts, or if\\nwe cannot retain highly skilled workers and key leaders, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and\\nservices may be adversely a\\ufb00ected. In addition, e\\ufb00ective succession planning is important to our long-term\\nsuccess. Any unsuccessful implementation of our succession plans or failure to ensure e\\ufb00ective transfer of 14 knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could adversely a\\ufb00ect our business, \\ufb01nancial condition,\\nor results of operations.\\nClimate change or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively\\na\\ufb00ect our business and results of operations.\\nClimate change resulting from increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the\\natmosphere could present risks to our operations, including an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather\\npatterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. Natural disasters and extreme\\nweather conditions, such as a hurricane, tornado, earthquake, wild\\ufb01re or \\ufb02ooding, may pose physical risks to our\\nfacilities and disrupt the operation of our supply chain. The impacts of the changing climate on water resources\\nmay result in water scarcity, limiting our ability to access su\\ufb03cient high-quality water in certain locations, which\\nmay increase operational costs.\\nConcern over climate change may also result in new or additional legal or regulatory requirements designed to\\nreduce greenhouse gas emissions and/or mitigate the e\\ufb00ects of climate change on the environment. If such laws or\\nregulations are more stringent than current legal or regulatory obligations, we may experience disruption in, or an\\nincrease in the costs associated with sourcing, manufacturing and distribution of our products, which may\\nadversely a\\ufb00ect our business, results of operations or \\ufb01nancial condition. Further, the impacts of climate change\\nhave an in\\ufb02uence on customer preferences, and failure to provide climate-friendly products could potentially result\\nin loss of market share.\\nAn information security incident, including a cybersecurity breach, could have a negative impact to\\nthe Company\\u2019s business or reputation.\\nTo meet business objectives, the Company relies on both internal information technology (IT) systems and\\nnetworks, and those of third parties and their vendors, to process and store sensitive data, including con\\ufb01dential\\nresearch, business plans, \\ufb01nancial information, intellectual property, and personal data that may be subject to legal\\nprotection, and ensure the continuity of the Company\\u2019s supply chain. The extensive information security and\\ncybersecurity threats, which a\\ufb00ect companies globally, pose a risk to the security and availability of these systems\\nand networks, and the con\\ufb01dentiality, integrity, and availability of the Company\\u2019s sensitive data. The Company\\ncontinually assesses these threats and makes investments to increase internal protection, detection, and response\\ncapabilities, as well as ensure the Company\\u2019s third-party providers have required capabilities and controls, to\\naddress this risk. To date, the Company has not experienced any material impact to the business or operations\\nresulting from information or cybersecurity attacks; however, because of the frequently changing attack\\ntechniques, along with the increased volume and sophistication of the attacks, there is the potential for the\\nCompany to be adversely impacted. This impact could result in reputational, competitive, operational or other\\nbusiness harm as well as \\ufb01nancial costs and regulatory action. The Company maintains cybersecurity insurance in\\nthe event of an information security or cyber incident; however, the coverage may not be su\\ufb03cient to cover all\\n\\ufb01nancial, legal, business or reputational losses.\\nAs a result of the Russia-Ukraine War, there has been, and we expect there will continue to be, an increased risk of\\ninformation security or cybersecurity incidents, including cyberattacks perpetrated by Russia or others at its\\ndirection. Although we have taken steps to enhance our protections against these attacks, we may not be able to\\naddress the threat of information security or cybersecurity incidents proactively or implement adequate\\npreventative measures and we may not be able to detect and address any such disruption or security breach\\npromptly, or at all, which could adversely a\\ufb00ect our business, results of operations or \\ufb01nancial condition. Moreover,\\nwe are aware of incidents in which our third-party partners have been the target of information security or\\ncybersecurity incidents as a result of the Russia-Ukraine War. Although, to date, our IT Systems have not been\\ncompromised by these incidents, it is possible that future information security or cybersecurity incidents involving\\nour customers, manufacturers, suppliers or other third-party partners could successfully compromise our IT\\nSystems, which could adversely a\\ufb00ect our business, results of operations or \\ufb01nancial condition.\\nA breach of privacy laws or unauthorized access, loss or misuse of personal data could have a\\nnegative impact to the Company\\u2019s business or reputation.\\nThe Company is subject to privacy and data protection laws across the globe that impose broad compliance\\nobligations on the collection, use, storage, access, transfer and protection of personal data. Breach of such\\nrequirements could result in substantial \\ufb01nes, penalties, private right of actions, claims and damage to our\\nreputation and business. New privacy laws are expected in other territories, together with greater privacy\\nenforcement by governmental authorities globally, particularly on data localization requirements and international\\ndata \\ufb02ows. The Company has established privacy compliance programs and controls that our businesses worldwide\\nare required to comply with, but with many technology and data-driven initiatives being prioritized across the\\nCompany and involving multiple vendors and third parties, there are potential risks of controls imposed on cross\\nborder data \\ufb02ows, unauthorized access, and loss of personal data through internal and external threats that could\\nimpact our business operations and research activities. 15 Item 1B.UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0Not applicable.\\nItem 2.PROPERTIES\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0The Company's subsidiaries operate 89 manufacturing facilities occupying approximately 14.9\\u00a0million square\\nfeet of \\ufb02oor space.

The operational sales growth of INVEGA SUSTENNA/XEPLION (paliperidone palmitate) and INVEGA\\nTRINZA/TREVICTA from new patient starts and persistence as well as the launch of INVEGA HAFYERA was o\\ufb00set by\\nnegative currency impacts and lower sales of RISPERDAL CONSTA.\\nOncology products achieved sales of $16.0 billion in 2022, representing an increase of 9.9% as compared to the\\nprior year. Contributions to operational growth were strong sales of DARZALEX (daratumumab) driven by share\\ngains in all regions, continued strong market growth, and uptake of the subcutaneous formulation as well as the\\ncontinued global launch uptake of ERLEADA (apalutamide). This was partially o\\ufb00set by declining sales of\\nIMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) due to competitive pressures and market suppression and ZYTIGA due to loss of exclusivity in\\nthe European Union in the second half of 2022.\\nPulmonary Hypertension products sales were $3.4 billion, a decline of 1.0% as compared to the prior year. The\\noperational sales growth of OPSUMIT (macitentan) and UPTRAVI (selexipag) due to continued share gains and\\nmarket growth was o\\ufb00set by COVID-19 related impacts and continued declines in Other Pulmonary Hypertension.\\nCardiovascular/Metabolism/Other products sales were $3.9 billion, a decline of 5.6% as compared to the prior\\nyear. The operational decline was primarily attributable to lower sales of INVOKANA/INVOKAMET (canagli\\ufb02ozin) due\\nto share erosion and PROCRIT/ EPREX(epoetin alfa) due to biosimilar competition.\\nThe Company updated its policy so that no end customer will be permitted direct delivery of product to a\\nlocation other than the billing location. The policy impacts contract pharmacy transactions involving non-grantee\\n340B covered entities for most of the Company\\u2019s drugs, subject to multiple exceptions. Both grantee and non-\\ngrantee covered entities can maintain certain contract pharmacy arrangements under policy exceptions. The\\nCompany has been and will continue to o\\ufb00er 340B discounts to covered entities on all of its covered outpatient\\ndrugs, and it believes its policy will improve its ability to identify inappropriate duplicate discounts and diversion\\nprohibited by the 340B statute. The 340B Drug Pricing Program is a U.S. federal government program requiring\\ndrug manufacturers to provide signi\\ufb01cant discounts on covered outpatient drugs to covered entities.

As of January 1, 2023, the net debt position was $16.1 billion as compared to the prior\\nyear of $2.1 billion. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Abiomed, Inc. in December 2022. The debt\\nbalance at the end of 2022 was $39.7 billion as compared to $33.8 billion in 2021. Considering recent market\\nconditions, the Company has re-evaluated its operating cash \\ufb02ows and liquidity pro\\ufb01le and does not foresee any\\nsigni\\ufb01cant incremental risk. The Company anticipates that operating cash \\ufb02ows, the ability to raise funds from\\nexternal sources, borrowing capacity from existing committed credit facilities and access to the commercial paper\\nmarkets will continue to provide su\\ufb03cient resources to fund operating needs, including the Company's remaining\\nbalance to be paid on the agreement to settle opioid litigation for approximately $2.7 billion and the establishment\\nof the $2.0 billion trust for talc related liabilities (See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for\\nadditional details). In addition, the Company monitors the global capital markets on an ongoing basis and from time\\nto time may raise capital when market conditions are favorable. E\\ufb00ective beginning in \\ufb01scal 2022, the U.S. Tax Cuts\\nand Job Act of 2017 (TCJA) requires the Company to deduct U.S. and international research and development\\nexpenditures for tax purposes over 5 to 15 years, instead of in the current \\ufb01scal year. As a result, in \\ufb01scal 2022, the\\nCompany experienced an increase in annual cash tax payments of approximately $1.2 billion above what otherwise\\nwould have been remitted to the U.S Treasury. The Company concurrently records a deferred tax bene\\ufb01t for the\\nfuture amortization of the research and development (R&D) for tax purposes. The requirement to expense R&D as\\nincurred is unchanged for U.S. GAAP purposes and the impact to pre-tax R&D expense is not a\\ufb00ected by this\\nprovision.\\nOn September 14, 2022, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a share repurchase\\nprogram, authorizing the Company to purchase up to $5.0 billion of the Company's Common Stock. Share\\nrepurchases may be made at management\\u2019s discretion from time to time on the open market or through privately\\nnegotiated transactions. The repurchase program has no time limit and may be suspended for periods or\\ndiscontinued at any time. Any shares acquired will be available\\n32 for general corporate purposes. The Company intends to \\ufb01nance the share repurchase program through available\\ncash. Through January\\u00a01, 2023, approximately $2.5 billion has been repurchased under the program.\\nThe following table summarizes the Company\\u2019s material contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as\\nof January\\u00a01, 2023: To satisfy these obligations, the Company intends to use cash from operations.\\n(Dollars in Millions)Tax Legislation\\n(TCJA) Debt ObligationsInterest on\\nDebt Obligations Total\\n2023 $ 1,522\\u00a0 1,551\\u00a0 893\\u00a0 3,966\\u00a0\\n2024 2,029\\u00a0 1,392\\u00a0 843\\u00a0 4,264\\u00a0\\n2025 2,536\\u00a0 1,667\\u00a0 789\\u00a0 4,992\\u00a0\\n2026 \\u2014\\u00a0 1,996\\u00a0 744\\u00a0 2,740\\u00a0\\n2027 \\u2014\\u00a0 2,271\\u00a0 736\\u00a0 3,007\\u00a0\\nAfter 2026 \\u2014\\u00a0 19,562\\u00a0 8,772\\u00a0 28,334\\u00a0\\nTotal $ 6,087\\u00a0 28,439\\u00a0 12,777\\u00a0 47,303\\u00a0\\nFor tax matters, see Note\\u00a08 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\\nFinancing and Market Risk\\nThe Company uses \\ufb01nancial instruments to manage the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on cash \\ufb02ows.\\nAccordingly, the Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to protect the value of certain foreign\\ncurrency assets and liabilities and to hedge future foreign currency transactions primarily related to product costs.\\nGains or losses on these contracts are o\\ufb00set by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions. A 10%\\nappreciation of the U.S.\\u00a0Dollar from the January\\u00a01, 2023 market rates would increase the unrealized value of the\\nCompany\\u2019s forward contracts by $0.1 billion. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S.\\u00a0Dollar from the January\\u00a01,\\n2023 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of the Company\\u2019s forward contracts by $0.1\\u00a0billion. In\\neither scenario, the gain or loss on the forward contract would be o\\ufb00set by the gain or loss on the underlying\\ntransaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated earnings and cash \\ufb02ows.\\nThe Company hedges the exposure to \\ufb02uctuations in currency exchange rates, and the e\\ufb00ect on certain assets\\nand liabilities in foreign currency, by entering into currency swap contracts. A 1% change in the spread between\\nU.S.\\u00a0and foreign interest rates on the Company\\u2019s interest rate sensitive \\ufb01nancial instruments would either increase\\nor decrease the unrealized value of the Company\\u2019s swap contracts by approximately $1.7 billion. In either scenario,\\nat maturity, the gain or loss on the swap contract would be o\\ufb00set by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction,\\nand therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated cash \\ufb02ows.\\nThe Company does not enter into \\ufb01nancial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, the\\nCompany has a policy of only entering into contracts with parties that have at least an investment grade credit\\nrating. The counterparties to these contracts are major \\ufb01nancial institutions and there is no signi\\ufb01cant\\nconcentration of exposure with any one counterparty. Management believes the risk of loss is remote. The\\nCompany entered into credit support agreements (CSA) with certain derivative counterparties establishing\\ncollateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting agreements. See Note\\u00a06 to the Consolidated\\nFinancial Statements for additional details on credit support agreements.\\nThe Company invests in both \\ufb01xed rate and \\ufb02oating rate interest earning securities which carry a degree of\\ninterest rate risk. The fair market value of \\ufb01xed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest\\nrates, while \\ufb02oating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. A 1% (100 basis\\npoints) change in spread on the Company\\u2019s interest rate sensitive investments would either increase or decrease\\nthe unrealized value of cash equivalents and current marketable securities by less than $0.1 billion.\\nThe Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In September 2022, the\\nCompany secured a new 364-day Credit Facility of $10\\u00a0billion, which expires on September\\u00a07, 2023. In November\\n2022, the Company secured an additional 364-day revolving Credit Facility of $10 billion, which has an expiration of\\nNovember 21, 2023. Interest charged on borrowings under the credit line agreement is based on either Secured\\nOvernight Financing Rate (SOFR) Reference Rate or other applicable market rate as allowed plus applicable\\nmargins. Commitment fees under the agreement are not material.\\nTotal borrowings at the end of 2022 and 2021 were $39.7\\u00a0billion and $33.8\\u00a0billion, respectively. The increase in\\nborrowings was due to the acquisition of Abiomed, Inc. In 2022, net debt (cash and current marketable securities,\\nnet of debt) was $16.1\\u00a0billion compared to net debt of $2.1 billion in 2021. Total debt represented 34.1% of total\\ncapital (shareholders\\u2019 equity and total debt) in 2022 and 31.3% of total capital in 2021. Shareholders\\u2019 equity per\\nshare at the end of 2022 was $29.39 compared to $28.16 at year-end 2021.\\nA summary of borrowings can be found in Note\\u00a07 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\\n33 Dividends\\nThe Company increased its dividend in 2022 for the 60th\\u00a0consecutive year. Cash dividends paid were $4.45 per\\nshare in 2022 and $4.19 per share in 2021.\\nOn January 3, 2023, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $1.13 per share, payable on March\\n7, 2023 to shareholders of record as of February 21, 2023.\\nOther Information\\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\\nManagement\\u2019s discussion and analysis of results of operations and \\ufb01nancial condition are based on the Company\\u2019s\\nconsolidated \\ufb01nancial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally\\naccepted in the U.S.\\u00a0(GAAP). The preparation of these \\ufb01nancial statements requires that management make\\nestimates and assumptions that a\\ufb00ect the amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other\\nrelated disclosures. Actual results may or may not di\\ufb00er from these estimates. The Company believes that the\\nunderstanding of certain key accounting policies and estimates are essential in achieving more insight into the\\nCompany\\u2019s operating results and \\ufb01nancial condition. These key accounting policies include revenue recognition,\\nincome taxes, legal and self-insurance contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets, assumptions used to determine\\nthe amounts recorded for pensions and other employee bene\\ufb01t plans and accounting for stock based awards.\\nRevenue Recognition:\\u00a0The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of\\na contract with the customer are satis\\ufb01ed; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to\\ncustomers. The Company's global payment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Provisions for certain\\nrebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns, discounts to customers and governmental\\nclawback provisions are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales.\\nProduct discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market\\nparticipants, as well as market conditions, including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates are estimated\\nbased on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market\\nconditions in the various markets served. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of\\nproducts primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data,\\nas well as internally generated information.\\nSales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that\\nexhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are speci\\ufb01cally\\ninvestigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals.\\nSales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in\\nthe \\ufb01eld, or in speci\\ufb01c areas, product recall. The sales returns reserve is based on historical return trends by\\nproduct and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Company\\u2019s accounting policies, the\\nCompany generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Company\\u2019s sales returns reserves are\\naccounted for in accordance with the U.S.\\u00a0GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales\\nreturns reserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales returns in the Consumer Health and Pharmaceutical\\nsegments are almost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the MedTech segment are\\ntypically resalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned\\nproducts. The sales returns reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales\\nduring the \\ufb01scal years\\u00a02022, 2021 and 2020.\\nPromotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are\\nrecorded in the same period as related sales. Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based\\nsales incentive programs. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience\\nby product and value. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the\\nincentive period and are recorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the\\nappropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company also earns pro\\ufb01t-share\\npayments through collaborative arrangements of certain products, which are included in sales to customers. Pro\\ufb01t-\\nshare payments were less than 2.0% of the total revenues in \\ufb01scal year 2022 and less than 3.0% of the total\\nrevenues in \\ufb01scal years 2021 and 2020 and are included in sales to customers.\\nIn addition, the Company enters into collaboration arrangements that contain multiple revenue generating\\nactivities. Amounts due from collaborative partners for these arrangements are recognized as each activity is\\nperformed or delivered, based on the relative selling price.

The Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations\\nand rates. Future changes in tax laws and rates may a\\ufb00ect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities.\\nThe Company has unrecognized tax bene\\ufb01ts for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP, which\\nprescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the \\ufb01nancial statement recognition and\\nmeasurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Management believes that changes in\\nthese estimates would not have a material e\\ufb00ect on the Company's results of operations, cash \\ufb02ows or \\ufb01nancial\\nposition.\\nThe Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31, 2017\\nfrom its international subsidiaries. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings\\nsubsequent to January 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be\\ninde\\ufb01nitely reinvested. The Company intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in those international\\noperations. If the Company decides at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be\\nrequired to provide for the net tax e\\ufb00ects on these amounts. The Company estimates that the tax e\\ufb00ect of this\\nrepatriation would be approximately $0.5 billion under currently enacted tax laws and regulations and at current\\ncurrency exchange rates. This amount does not include the possible bene\\ufb01t of U.S. foreign tax credits, which may\\nsubstantially o\\ufb00set this cost.\\nSee Note 1 and Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes.\\nLegal and Self Insurance Contingencies:\\u00a0The Company records accruals for various contingencies, including\\nlegal proceedings and product liability claims as these arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are\\nbased on management\\u2019s judgment as to the probability of losses and, where applicable, actuarially determined\\nestimates. The Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to\\naccruals in the self insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are\\nprobable and amounts can be reasonably estimated.\\nThe Company follows the provisions of U.S.\\u00a0GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is\\nrecorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.\\nSee Notes 1 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding product liability\\nand legal proceedings.(1)\\n(1)\\n(1)\\n36 Long-Lived and Intangible Assets:\\u00a0The Company assesses changes, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in\\neconomic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash \\ufb02ows in evaluating the value of the\\nCompany\\u2019s property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. As these assumptions and estimates\\nmay change over time, it may or may not be necessary for the Company to record impairment charges.\\nEmployee Bene\\ufb01t Plans:\\u00a0The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including de\\ufb01ned bene\\ufb01t,\\nde\\ufb01ned contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. These plans are\\nbased on assumptions for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary\\nincreases, healthcare cost trend rates and attrition rates. See Note\\u00a010 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for\\nfurther details on these rates.\\nStock Based Compensation:\\u00a0The Company recognizes compensation expense associated with the issuance of\\nequity instruments to employees for their services. Based on the type of equity instrument, the fair value is\\nestimated on the date of grant using either the Black-Scholes option valuation model or a combination of both the\\nBlack-Scholes option valuation model and Monte Carlo valuation model, and is expensed in the \\ufb01nancial statements\\nover the service period. The input assumptions used in determining fair value are the expected life, expected\\nvolatility, risk-free rate and expected dividend yield. For performance share units, the fair market value is\\ncalculated for the two component goals at the date of grant: adjusted operational earnings per share and relative\\ntotal shareholder return. The fair values for the earnings per share goal of each performance share unit was\\nestimated on the date of grant using the fair market value of the shares at the time of the award, discounted for\\ndividends, which are not paid on the performance share units during the vesting period.\\u00a0The fair value for the\\nrelative total shareholder return goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the\\nMonte Carlo valuation model. See Note\\u00a016 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\\nRefer to Note\\u00a01 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and\\nrecently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of January\\u00a01, 2023.\\n37 Economic and Market Factors\\nThe Company is aware that its products are used in an environment where, for more than a decade,\\npolicymakers, consumers and businesses have expressed concerns about the rising cost of healthcare. In response\\nto these concerns, the Company has a long-standing policy of pricing products responsibly. For the period 2012\\u00a0-\\n2022, in the U.S., the weighted average compound annual growth rate of the Company\\u2019s net price increases for\\nhealthcare products (prescription and over-the-counter drugs, hospital and professional products) was below the\\nU.S.\\u00a0Consumer Price Index (CPI).\\nThe Company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present signi\\ufb01cant\\nchallenges. The Company continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate actions. In\\ufb02ation rates\\ncontinue to have an e\\ufb00ect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way companies operate. The\\nCompany has accounted for operations in Argentina and Venezuela as highly in\\ufb02ationary, as the prior three-year\\ncumulative in\\ufb02ation rate surpassed 100%. Beginning in the \\ufb01scal second quarter of 2022, the Company accounted\\nfor operations in Turkey as highly in\\ufb02ationary, as the prior three-year cumulative in\\ufb02ation rate surpassed 100%.\\nThis did not have a material impact to the Company's results in the period. In the face of increasing costs, the\\nCompany strives to maintain its pro\\ufb01t margins through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and\\nperiodic price increases.\\nRussia-Ukraine War\\nAlthough the long-term implications of Russia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine are di\\ufb03cult to predict at this time, the \\ufb01nancial\\nimpact of the con\\ufb02ict in the \\ufb01scal 2022, including accounts receivable or inventory reserves, was not material. As of\\nboth the \\ufb01scal years ending January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022, the business of the Company\\u2019s Ukraine\\nsubsidiaries represented less than 1% of the Company\\u2019s consolidated assets and revenues. As of both the \\ufb01scal\\nyears ending January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022, the business of the Company\\u2019s Russian subsidiaries represented\\nless than 1% of the Company\\u2019s consolidated assets and represented 1% of revenues.\\nIn early March, the Company took steps to suspend all advertising, enrollment in clinical trials, and any additional\\ninvestment in Russia. Additionally, at the end of March, the Company made the decision to suspend supply of\\npersonal care products in Russia. The Company continues to supply its other products as patients rely on many of\\nthe products for healthcare purposes.\\nThe Company is exposed to \\ufb02uctuations in currency exchange rates. A 1% change in the value of the U.S.\\u00a0Dollar\\nas compared to all foreign currencies in which the Company had sales, income or expense in 2022 would have\\nincreased or decreased the translation of foreign sales by approximately $0.5\\u00a0billion and net income by\\napproximately $0.1\\u00a0billion.\\nGovernments around the world consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws, which may include\\nincreasing or decreasing existing statutory tax rates. In connection with various government initiatives, companies\\nare required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to\\ngreater audit scrutiny of pro\\ufb01ts earned in other countries. A change in statutory tax rate in any country would\\nresult in the revaluation of the Company\\u2019s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in\\nthe period in which the new tax law is enacted.\\u00a0 This change would result in an expense or bene\\ufb01t recorded to the\\nCompany\\u2019s Consolidated Statement of Earnings.\\u00a0 The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in\\nthe countries where it operates. Changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time, and any related expense\\nor bene\\ufb01t recorded may be material to the \\ufb01scal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted.\\nThe Company faces various worldwide healthcare changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that\\ninclude healthcare cost containment and government legislation relating to sales, promotions, pricing and\\nreimbursement of healthcare products.\\nChanges in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of healthcare products and services, including\\ndelaying medical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and\\nforegoing healthcare insurance coverage, as a result of the current global economic downturn, may continue to\\nimpact the Company\\u2019s businesses.\\nThe Company also operates in an environment increasingly hostile to intellectual property rights. Firms have\\n\\ufb01led Abbreviated New Drug Applications or Biosimilar Biological Product Applications with the U.S. FDA or otherwise\\nchallenged the coverage and/or validity of the Company's patents, seeking to market generic or biosimilar forms of\\nmany of the Company\\u2019s key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those\\nproducts. In the event the Company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the resulting\\nlawsuits, generic or biosimilar versions of the products at issue will be introduced to the market, resulting in the\\npotential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products, and which may result in a non-cash\\nimpairment charge in any associated intangible asset. There is also a risk that one or more competitors could\\nlaunch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory approval even though one or\\nmore valid patents are in place.\\nLegal Proceedings\\nJohnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product\\nliability, intellectual property, commercial, employment, indemni\\ufb01cation and other matters; governmental\\ninvestigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business.\\nThe Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable\\nthat a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of January\\u00a01, 2023, the\\nCompany has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be\\nreasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal\\nissue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based 38 on new information and further developments in accordance with ASC 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and\\nregulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to\\nestimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies\\noften result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on\\nestimates and assumptions including timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and\\njudgments can be a\\ufb00ected by various factors including, among other things, whether damages sought in the\\nproceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scienti\\ufb01c and legal discovery has not commenced or is not\\ncomplete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are signi\\ufb01cant facts in\\ndispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential claims;\\nability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements; complexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims;\\nand/or there are numerous parties involved. To the extent adverse awards, judgments or verdicts have been\\nrendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable\\nand can be reasonably estimated.\\nIn the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions\\nwith counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company's balance sheet,\\nis not expected to have a material adverse e\\ufb00ect on the Company's \\ufb01nancial position. However, the resolution of,\\nor increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse\\ne\\ufb00ect on the Company's results of operations and cash \\ufb02ows for that period.\\nSee Note\\u00a019 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further information\\nregarding legal proceedings.\\nCommon Stock\\nThe Company\\u2019s Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol JNJ. As of February 10,\\n2023, there were 124,211 record holders of Common Stock of the Company.\\nItem 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0The information called for by this item is incorporated herein by reference to \\u201cItem 7.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n1. Summary of Signi\\ufb01cant Accounting Policies\\nPrinciples of Consolidation\\nThe consolidated \\ufb01nancial statements include the accounts of Johnson\\u00a0& Johnson and its subsidiaries (the\\nCompany). Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. Columns and rows within tables may not add\\ndue to rounding. Percentages have been calculated using actual, non-rounded \\ufb01gures.\\nDescription of the Company and Business Segments\\nThe Company has approximately 152,700 \\u00a0employees worldwide engaged in the research and development,\\nmanufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the healthcare \\ufb01eld. The Company conducts business in\\nvirtually all countries of the world and its primary focus is on products related to human health and well-being.\\nThe Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer Health, Pharmaceutical and MedTech. The\\nConsumer Health segment includes a broad range of products used in the Baby Care, Oral Care, Skin\\nHealth/Beauty, Over-the-Counter pharmaceutical, Women\\u2019s Health and Wound Care markets. These products are\\nmarketed to the general public and sold online (eCommerce) and to retail outlets and distributors throughout the\\nworld. The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on the following therapeutic areas, including Immunology, Infectious\\ndiseases, Neuroscience, Oncology, Pulmonary Hypertension, and Cardiovascular and Metabolic diseases. Products\\nin this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, distributors, hospitals and healthcare professionals\\nfor prescription use. The MedTech segment includes a broad portfolio of products used in the Orthopaedic, Surgery,\\nInterventional Solutions (cardiovascular and neurovascular) and Vision \\ufb01elds. These products are distributed to\\nwholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional \\ufb01elds by physicians, nurses, hospitals,\\neye care professionals and clinics.\\nIn November 2021, the Company announced its intention to separate the Company\\u2019s Consumer Health business\\n(Kenvue as the name for the planned New Consumer Health Company), with the intention to create a new, publicly\\ntraded company by the end of the \\ufb01scal year 2023.\\nNew Accounting Standards\\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\\nThere were no new material accounting standards adopted in \\ufb01scal 2022.\\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\\nNot Adopted as of January 1, 2023\\nASU 2022-04: Liabilities-Supplier Finance Programs (Topic 405-50) \\u2013 Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program\\nObligations\\nThis update requires that a buyer in a supplier \\ufb01nance program disclose additional information about the program\\nto allow \\ufb01nancial statement users to better understand the e\\ufb00ect of the programs on an entity\\u2019s working capital,\\nliquidity, and cash \\ufb02ows. This update will be e\\ufb00ective for the Company for \\ufb01scal years beginning after December\\n15, 2022, except for the amendment on roll forward information, which is e\\ufb00ective for \\ufb01scal years beginning after\\nDecember 15, 2023. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this update on\\nits disclosures and will adopt this standard in the \\ufb01scal \\ufb01rst quarter of 2023.\\nCash Equivalents\\nThe Company classi\\ufb01es all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of\\npurchase as cash equivalents and all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of greater than three months\\nfrom the date of purchase as current marketable securities. The Company has a policy of making investments only\\nwith commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The Company invests its cash\\nprimarily in government securities and obligations, corporate debt securities, money market funds and reverse\\nrepurchase agreements (RRAs).\\nRRAs are collateralized by deposits in the form of Government Securities and Obligations for an amount not less\\nthan 102 % of their value. The Company does not record an asset or liability as the Company is not permitted to\\nsell or repledge the associated collateral. The Company has a policy that the collateral has at least an A (or\\nequivalent) credit rating. The Company utilizes a third party custodian to manage the exchange of funds and\\nensure that collateral received is maintained at 102 % of the value of the RRAs on a daily basis. RRAs with stated\\nmaturities of greater than three months from the date of purchase are classi\\ufb01ed as marketable securities.\\nInvestments\\nInvestments classi\\ufb01ed as held to maturity investments are reported at amortized cost and realized gains or losses\\nare reported in earnings. Investments classi\\ufb01ed as available-for-sale debt securities are carried at estimated fair\\nvalue with unrealized gains and 46 losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Available-for-sale securities\\navailable for current operations are classi\\ufb01ed as current assets otherwise, they are classi\\ufb01ed as long term.\\nManagement determines the appropriate classi\\ufb01cation of its investment in debt and equity securities at the time of\\npurchase and re-evaluates such determination at each balance sheet date. The Company reviews its investments\\nfor impairment and adjusts these investments to fair value through earnings, as required. \\u00a0\\nProperty, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation\\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost. The Company utilizes the straight-line method of depreciation\\nover the estimated useful lives of the assets:\\nBuilding and building equipment 30 \\u00a0years\\nLand and leasehold improvements 10 \\u00a0- 20 \\u00a0years\\nMachinery and equipment 2 \\u00a0- 13 \\u00a0years\\nThe Company capitalizes certain computer software and development costs, included in machinery and\\nequipment, when incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use.\\nCapitalized software costs are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the software, which generally range\\nfrom 3 to 8 \\u00a0years.\\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets to assess recoverability using undiscounted cash \\ufb02ows. When certain\\nevents or changes in operating or economic conditions occur, an impairment assessment may be performed on the\\nrecoverability of the carrying value of these assets. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured\\nbased on the di\\ufb00erence between the asset\\u2019s fair value and its carrying value. If quoted market prices are not\\navailable, the Company will estimate fair value using a discounted value of estimated future cash \\ufb02ows.\\nRevenue Recognition\\nThe Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the\\ncustomer are satis\\ufb01ed; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to customers. The Company's\\nglobal payment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade\\npromotions, coupons, product returns, discounts to customers and governmental clawback provisions are\\naccounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales. The liability is recognized within\\nAccrued Rebates, Returns, and Promotions on the consolidated balance sheet.\\nProduct discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market\\nparticipants, as well as market conditions, including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates are estimated\\nbased on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market\\nconditions in the various markets served. A signi\\ufb01cant portion of the liability related to rebates is from the sale of\\nthe Company's pharmaceutical products within the U.S., primarily the Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid\\nprograms, which amounted to $ 9.6 billion and $ 7.7 billion as of January\\u00a01, 2023 and January\\u00a02, 2022, respectively.\\nThe Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of\\nwholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information.\\nSales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that\\nexhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are speci\\ufb01cally\\ninvestigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals.\\nSales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in\\nthe \\ufb01eld, or in speci\\ufb01c areas, product recall. The sales returns reserve is based on historical return trends by\\nproduct and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Company\\u2019s accounting policies, the\\nCompany generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Company\\u2019s sales returns reserves are\\naccounted for in accordance with the U.S.\\u00a0GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales\\nreturns reserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales returns in the Consumer Health and Pharmaceutical\\nsegments are almost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the MedTech segment are\\ntypically resalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned\\nproducts. The sales returns reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0 % of annual net trade sales\\nduring each of the \\ufb01scal years\\u00a02022,\\u00a02021\\u00a0and\\u00a02020.\\nPromotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are\\nrecorded in the same period as related sales. Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based\\nsales incentive programs. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience\\nby product and value. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the\\nincentive period and are recorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the\\nappropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company also earns pro\\ufb01t-share\\npayments through collaborative arrangements for certain products, which are included in sales to customers. Pro\\ufb01t-\\nshare payments were less than 2.0 % of the total revenues in \\ufb01scal year 2022 and less than 3.0 % of the total\\nrevenues in \\ufb01scal years 2021 and 2020 and are included in sales to customers.\\n47 See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further disaggregation of revenue.\\nShipping and Handling\\nShipping and handling costs incurred were $ 1.1 billion, $ 1.1 billion and $ 1.0 billion in \\ufb01scal years 2022, 2021 and\\n2020, respectively, and are included in selling, marketing and administrative expense. The amount of revenue\\nreceived for shipping and handling is less than 1.0 % of sales to customers for all periods presented.\\nInventories\\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value determined by the \\ufb01rst-in, \\ufb01rst-out method.\\nIntangible Assets and Goodwill\\nThe authoritative literature on U.S.\\u00a0GAAP requires that goodwill and intangible assets with inde\\ufb01nite lives be\\nassessed annually for impairment. The Company completed its annual impairment test for 2022 in the \\ufb01scal fourth\\nquarter. Future impairment tests will be performed annually in the \\ufb01scal fourth quarter, or sooner if warranted.\\nPurchased in-process research and development is accounted for as an inde\\ufb01nite lived intangible asset until the\\nunderlying project is completed, at which point the intangible asset will be accounted for as a de\\ufb01nite lived\\nintangible asset. If warranted the purchased in-process research and development could be written o\\ufb00 or partially\\nimpaired depending on the underlying program.\\nIntangible assets that have \\ufb01nite useful lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives, and are reviewed\\nfor impairment when warranted by economic conditions. See Note\\u00a05 for further details on Intangible Assets and\\nGoodwill.\\nFinancial Instruments\\nAs required by U.S.\\u00a0GAAP, all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Fair value is\\nthe exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-based\\nmeasurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The\\nauthoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value, with\\nLevel\\u00a01 having the highest priority and Level\\u00a03 having the lowest. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are\\nrecorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is\\ndesignated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction.\\nThe Company documents all relationships between hedged items and derivatives. The overall risk management\\nstrategy includes reasons for undertaking hedge transactions and entering into derivatives. The objectives of this\\nstrategy are: (1)\\u00a0minimize foreign currency exposure\\u2019s impact on the Company\\u2019s \\ufb01nancial performance; (2)\\u00a0protect\\nthe Company\\u2019s cash \\ufb02ow from adverse movements in foreign exchange rates; (3)\\u00a0ensure the appropriateness of\\n\\ufb01nancial instruments; and (4)\\u00a0manage the enterprise risk associated with \\ufb01nancial institutions. See Note\\u00a06 for\\nadditional information on Financial Instruments.\\nLeases\\nThe Company determines whether an arrangement is a lease at contract inception by establishing if the contract\\nconveys the right to control the use of identi\\ufb01ed property, plant, or equipment for a period of time in exchange for\\nconsideration. Right of Use (ROU) Assets and Lease Liabilities for operating leases are included in Other assets,\\nAccrued liabilities, and Other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The ROU Assets represent the right to\\nuse an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent an obligation to make lease payments\\narising from the lease. Commitments under \\ufb01nance leases are not signi\\ufb01cant, and are included in Property, plant\\nand equipment, Loans and notes payable, and Long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet.\\nROU Assets and Lease Liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value\\nof all minimum lease payments over the lease term. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on\\nthe information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments, when the\\nimplicit rate is not readily determinable. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease. These\\noptions are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option.\\nOperating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has elected the\\nfollowing policy elections on adoption: use of portfolio approach on leases of assets under master service\\nagreements, exclusion of short term leases on the balance sheet, and not separating lease and non-lease\\ncomponents.\\nThe Company primarily has operating lease for space, vehicles, manufacturing equipment and data processing\\nequipment. The ROU asset pertaining to operating leases was $ 1.1 \\u00a0billion and $ 0.9 \\u00a0billion in \\ufb01scal years 2022\\nand 2021, respectively. The lease liability was $ 1.3 \\u00a0billion and $ 1.0 \\u00a0billion in \\ufb01scal years 2022 and 2021,\\nrespectively. The operating lease costs were $ 0.3 \\u00a0billion in \\ufb01scal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Cash\\npaid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities were $ 0.3 \\u00a0billion in \\ufb01scal years 2022, 2021 and\\n2020, respectively.\\nProduct Liability\\nAccruals for product liability claims are recorded, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a liability has\\nbeen incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information and\\nactuarially determined estimates where applicable. The accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information\\nbecomes available. The Company 48 accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when those costs are probable and\\ncan be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the\\nCompany does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.\\nThe Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in\\nthe self insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and\\namounts can be reasonably estimated.\\nResearch and Development\\nResearch and development expenses are expensed as incurred in accordance with ASC 730, Research\\u00a0and\\nDevelopment. Upfront and milestone payments made to third parties in connection with research and development\\ncollaborations are expensed as incurred up to the point of regulatory approval. Payments made to third parties\\nsubsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related\\nproduct. Amounts capitalized for such payments are included in other intangibles, net of accumulated amortization.\\nThe Company enters into collaborative arrangements, typically with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology\\ncompanies, to develop and commercialize drug candidates or intellectual property. These arrangements typically\\ninvolve two (or more) parties who are active participants in the collaboration and are exposed to signi\\ufb01cant risks\\nand rewards dependent on the commercial success of the activities. These collaborations usually involve various\\nactivities by one or more parties, including research and development, marketing and selling and distribution.\\nOften, these collaborations require upfront, milestone and royalty or pro\\ufb01t share payments, contingent upon the\\noccurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Amounts due from\\ncollaborative partners related to development activities are generally re\\ufb02ected as a reduction of research and\\ndevelopment expense because the performance of contract development services is not central to the Company\\u2019s\\noperations. In general, the income statement presentation for these collaborations is as follows:\\nNature/Type of Collaboration \\u00a0Statement of Earnings Presentation\\nThird-party sale of product & pro\\ufb01t share payments\\nreceivedSales to customers\\nRoyalties/milestones paid to collaborative partner (post-\\nregulatory approval)*Cost of products sold\\nRoyalties received from collaborative partner Other income (expense), net\\nUpfront payments\\u00a0& milestones paid to collaborative\\npartner (pre-regulatory approval)Research and development expense\\nResearch and development payments to collaborative\\npartnerResearch and development expense\\nResearch and development payments received from\\ncollaborative partner or government entityReduction of Research and development expense\\n*Milestones are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the useful life.\\nFor all years presented, there was no individual project that represented greater than 5 % of the total annual\\nconsolidated research and development expense.\\nThe Company has a number of products and compounds developed in collaboration with strategic partners\\nincluding XARELTO, co-developed with Bayer HealthCare AG and IMBRUVICA, developed in collaboration and co-\\nmarketed with Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie company.\\nSeparately, the Company has a number of licensing arrangements for products and compounds including\\nDARZALEX, licensed from Genmab A/S.\\nAdvertising\\nCosts associated with advertising are expensed in the year incurred and are included in selling, marketing and\\nadministrative expenses. Advertising expenses worldwide, which comprised television, radio, print media and\\nInternet advertising, were $ 2.1 billion, $ 2.7 billion and $ 2.1 billion in \\ufb01scal years 2022, 2021 and 2020,\\nrespectively.\\nIncome Taxes\\nIncome taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the results of\\nany di\\ufb00erence between U.S. GAAP accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities. The\\nCompany estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates. Future changes\\nin tax laws and rates may a\\ufb00ect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future.\\nThe Company has unrecognized tax bene\\ufb01ts for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP which\\nprescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the \\ufb01nancial statement recognition and\\nmeasurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Management believes that changes in\\nthese estimates would not have a material e\\ufb00ect on the Company's results of operations, cash \\ufb02ows or \\ufb01nancial\\nposition.\\nIn 2017, the United States enacted into law new U.S. tax legislation, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). This\\nlaw included provisions for a comprehensive overhaul of the corporate income tax code, including a reduction of\\nthe statutory corporate tax rate from 35 % to 21 %, e\\ufb00ective on January 1, 2018. The TCJA included a provision for\\na tax on all previously\\n49 undistributed earnings of U.S. companies located in foreign jurisdictions. Undistributed earnings in the form of cash\\nand cash equivalents were taxed at a rate of 15.5 % and all other earnings were taxed at a rate of 8.0 %. This tax is\\npayable over 8 years and will not accrue interest. These payments began in 2018 and will continue through 2025.\\nThe remaining balance at the end of the 2022 was approximately $ 6.1 \\u00a0billion, of which $ 4.6 \\u00a0billion is classi\\ufb01ed as\\nnoncurrent and re\\ufb02ected as \\u201cLong-term taxes payable\\u201d on the Company\\u2019s balance sheet. The balance of this\\naccount is related to receivables from tax authorities not expected to be received in the next 12 months.\\nThe TCJA also includes provisions for a tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI). GILTI is described as\\nthe excess of a U.S. shareholder\\u2019s total net foreign income over a deemed return on tangible assets, as provided by\\nthe TCJA. In January 2018, the FASB issued guidance that allows companies to elect as an accounting policy\\nwhether to record the tax e\\ufb00ects of GILTI in the period the tax liability is generated (i.e., \\u201cperiod cost\\u201d) or provide\\nfor deferred tax assets and liabilities related to basis di\\ufb00erences that exist and are expected to e\\ufb00ect the amount of\\nGILTI inclusion in future years upon reversal (i.e., \\u201cdeferred method\\u201d). The Company has elected to account for\\nGILTI under the deferred method. The deferred tax amounts recorded are based on the evaluation of temporary\\ndi\\ufb00erences that are expected to reverse as GILTI is incurred in future periods.\\nThe Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31, 2017\\nfrom its international subsidiaries. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings\\nsubsequent to January 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be\\ninde\\ufb01nitely reinvested. The Company intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in those international\\noperations. If the Company decides at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be\\nrequired to provide for the net tax e\\ufb00ects on these amounts. The Company estimates that the tax e\\ufb00ect of this\\nrepatriation would be approximately $ 0.5 billion under currently enacted tax laws and regulations and at current\\ncurrency exchange rates. This amount does not include the possible bene\\ufb01t of U.S. foreign tax credits, which may\\nsubstantially o\\ufb00set this cost.\\nSee Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes.\\nNet Earnings Per Share\\nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted\\naverage number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share re\\ufb02ects the potential\\ndilution that could occur if securities were exercised or converted into common stock using the treasury stock\\nmethod.\\nUse of Estimates\\nThe preparation of consolidated \\ufb01nancial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in\\nthe U.S.\\u00a0requires management to make estimates and assumptions that a\\ufb00ect the amounts reported. Estimates are\\nused when accounting for sales discounts, rebates, allowances and incentives, product liabilities, income taxes,\\nwithholding taxes, depreciation, amortization, employee bene\\ufb01ts, contingencies and intangible asset and liability\\nvaluations. Actual results may or may not di\\ufb00er from those estimates.\\nThe Company follows the provisions of U.S.\\u00a0GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is\\nrecorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. The best estimate of a loss within a range is\\naccrued; however, if no estimate in the range is better than any other, the minimum amount is accrued.\\nAnnual Closing Date\\nThe Company follows the concept of a \\ufb01scal year, which ends on the Sunday nearest to the end of the month of\\nDecember. Normally each \\ufb01scal year consists of 52\\u00a0weeks, but every \\ufb01ve or six years the \\ufb01scal year consists of\\n53\\u00a0weeks, and therefore includes additional shipping days, as was the case in \\ufb01scal year 2020, and will be the case\\nagain in \\ufb01scal year 2026.\\nReclassi\\ufb01cation\\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassi\\ufb01ed to conform to current year presentation.\\n50 2.

Fair Value Measurements\\nThe Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage its exposure to the variability of cash \\ufb02ows,\\nprimarily related to the foreign exchange rate changes of future intercompany products and third-party purchases\\nof materials denominated in a foreign currency. The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps to manage\\ncurrency risk primarily related to borrowings. Both types of derivatives are designated as cash \\ufb02ow hedges.\\nAdditionally, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps as an instrument to manage interest rate risk\\nrelated to \\ufb01xed rate borrowings. These derivatives are designated as fair value hedges. The Company uses cross\\ncurrency interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges.\\nAdditionally, the Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to o\\ufb00set its exposure to certain foreign\\ncurrency assets and liabilities. These forward foreign exchange contracts are not designated as hedges and\\ntherefore, changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recognized in earnings, thereby o\\ufb00setting the current\\nearnings e\\ufb00ect of the related foreign currency assets and liabilities.\\nIn the \\ufb01scal fourth quarter of 2022, the Company entered into forward starting interest rate swaps with notional\\namounts totaling $ 2.4 \\u00a0billion in contemplation of hedging interest rate risk associated with long-term \\ufb01nancing for\\nthe Consumer Health segment separation. These forward starting interest rate swaps are not designated as hedges\\nand therefore, changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recognized in earnings. At the end of the \\ufb01scal\\nyear 2022, the changes in fair value was not material and therefore not included in the table below.\\nThe Company does not enter into derivative \\ufb01nancial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, or that\\ncontain credit risk related contingent features. The Company maintains credit support agreements (CSA) with\\ncertain derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting\\nagreements. As of January\\u00a01, 2023, the total amount of cash collateral paid by the Company under the CSA\\namounted to $ 0.8 billion net, related to net investment and cash \\ufb02ow hedges. On an ongoing basis, the Company\\nmonitors counter-party credit ratings. The Company considers credit non-performance risk to be low, because the\\nCompany primarily enters into agreements with commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade\\ncredit rating. Refer to the table on signi\\ufb01cant \\ufb01nancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value contained in this\\nfootnote for receivables and payables with these commercial institutions. As of January\\u00a01, 2023, the Company had\\nnotional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps and\\ninterest rate swaps of $ 43.3 billion, $ 36.2 billion and $ 12.4 billion, respectively. As of January\\u00a02, 2022, the\\nCompany had notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate\\nswaps and interest rate swaps of $ 45.8 billion, $ 37.4 billion and $ 10.0 billion, respectively.\\nAll derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of\\nderivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether\\nthe derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction.\\nThe designation as a cash \\ufb02ow hedge is made at the entrance date of the derivative contract. At inception, all\\nderivatives are expected to be highly e\\ufb00ective. Foreign exchange contracts designated as cash \\ufb02ow hedges are\\naccounted for under the forward method and all gains/losses associated with these contracts will be recognized in\\nthe income statement when the hedged item impacts earnings.\\u00a0Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are\\nrecorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until the underlying transaction a\\ufb00ects earnings, and are\\nthen reclassi\\ufb01ed to earnings in the same account as the hedged transaction.\\nGains and losses associated with interest rate swaps and changes in fair value of hedged debt attributable to\\nchanges in interest rates are recorded to interest expense in the period in which they occur. Gains and losses on\\nnet investment hedges are accounted through the currency translation account within accumulated other\\ncomprehensive income.\\u00a0The portion excluded from e\\ufb00ectiveness testing is recorded through interest (income)\\nexpense using the spot method. On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses whether each derivative continues to\\nbe highly e\\ufb00ective in o\\ufb00setting changes of hedged items. If and when a derivative is no longer expected to be\\nhighly e\\ufb00ective, hedge accounting is discontinued.\\nThe Company designated its Euro denominated notes issued in May 2016 with due dates ranging from 2022 to\\n2035 as a net investment hedge of the Company's investments in certain of its international subsidiaries that use\\nthe Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility caused by changes in exchange rates.\\nAs of January\\u00a01, 2023, the balance of deferred net loss on derivatives included in accumulated other\\ncomprehensive income was $ 230 million\\u00a0after-tax. For additional information, see the Consolidated Statements of\\nComprehensive Income and Note\\u00a013. The Company expects that substantially all of the amounts related to forward\\nforeign exchange contracts will be reclassi\\ufb01ed into earnings over the next 12 months as a result of transactions\\nthat are expected to occur over that period. The maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging\\ntransaction exposure is 18 months, excluding interest rate contracts and net investment hedges. The amount\\nultimately realized in earnings may di\\ufb00er as foreign exchange rates change. Realized gains and losses are\\nultimately determined by actual exchange rates at maturity of the derivative.\\n54 The following table is a summary of the activity related to derivatives and hedges for the \\ufb01scal years ended\\nJanuary\\u00a01, 2023 and January\\u00a02, 2022, net of tax:\\nJanuary 1, 2023 January 2, 2022\\n(Dollars in Millions) SalesCost of\\nProducts\\nSoldR&D\\nExpenseInterest\\n(Income)\\nExpenseOther\\n(Income)\\nExpenseSalesCost of\\nProducts\\nSoldR&D\\nExpenseInterest\\n(Income)\\nExpenseOther\\n(Income)\\nExpense\\nThe e\\ufb00ects of fair value,\\nnet investment and cash\\n\\ufb02ow hedging:\\nGain (Loss) on fair\\nvalue hedging\\nrelationship:\\nInterest rate swaps\\ncontracts:\\n\\u00a0Hedged items $\\u2014 \\u00a0 \\u2014 \\u00a0 \\u2014 \\u00a0( 1,098 ) \\u2014 \\u00a0 \\u2014 \\u00a0 \\u2014 \\u00a0 \\u2014 \\u00a0( 109 ) \\u2014 \\u00a0\\n\\u00a0Derivatives designated\\nas hedging instruments \\u2014 \\u00a0 \\u2014 \\u00a0 \\u2014 \\u00a01,098 \\u00a0 \\u2014 \\u00a0 \\u2014 \\u00a0 \\u2014 \\u00a0 \\u2014 \\u00a0 109 \\u00a0 \\u2014 \\u00a0\\nGain (Loss) on net\\ninvestment hedging\\nrelationship:\\nCross currency\\ninterest rate swaps\\ncontracts:\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0Amount of gain or\\n(loss) recognized in\\nincome on derivative\\namount excluded from\\ne\\ufb00ectiveness testing $\\u2014 \\u00a0 \\u2014 \\u00a0 \\u2014 \\u00a0 140 \\u00a0 \\u2014 \\u00a0 \\u2014 \\u00a0 \\u2014 \\u00a0 \\u2014 \\u00a0 174 \\u00a0 \\u2014 \\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0Amount of gain or\\n(loss) recognized in AOCI \\u2014 \\u00a0 \\u2014 \\u00a0 \\u2014 \\u00a0 140 \\u00a0 \\u2014 \\u00a0 \\u2014 \\u00a0 \\u2014 \\u00a0 \\u2014 \\u00a0 174 \\u00a0 \\u2014 \\u00a0\\nGain (Loss) on cash\\n\\ufb02ow hedging\\nrelationship:\\nForward foreign\\nexchange contracts:\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0Amount of gain or\\n(loss) reclassi\\ufb01ed from\\nAOCI into income ( 72 )( 271 ) 149 \\u00a0 \\u2014 \\u00a0 ( 23 ) 17 \\u00a0 119 \\u00a0 30 \\u00a0 \\u2014 \\u00a0 47 \\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0Amount of gain or\\n(loss) recognized in AOCI 5 \\u00a0 319 \\u00a0 61 \\u00a0 \\u2014 \\u00a0( 113 )( 94 )( 557 ) 123 \\u00a0 \\u2014 \\u00a0 146 \\u00a0\\nCross currency\\ninterest rate swaps\\ncontracts:\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0Amount of gain or\\n(loss) reclassi\\ufb01ed from\\nAOCI into income \\u2014 \\u00a0 \\u2014 \\u00a0 \\u2014 \\u00a0 425 \\u00a0 \\u2014 \\u00a0 \\u2014 \\u00a0 \\u2014 \\u00a0 \\u2014 \\u00a0 402 \\u00a0 \\u2014 \\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0Amount of gain or\\n(loss) recognized in AOCI$\\u2014 \\u00a0 \\u2014 \\u00a0 \\u2014 \\u00a0 42 \\u00a0 \\u2014 \\u00a0 \\u2014 \\u00a0 \\u2014 \\u00a0 \\u2014 \\u00a0 9 \\u00a0 \\u2014 \\u00a0\\nAs of January\\u00a01, 2023 and January\\u00a02, 2022, the following amounts were recorded on the consolidated balance sheet\\nrelated to cumulative basis adjustment for fair value hedges\\nLine item in the Consolidated\\nBalance Sheet in which the\\nhedged item is includedCarrying Amount of the Hedged\\nLiabilityCumulative Amount of F air Value\\nHedging Adjustment Included in the\\nCarrying Amount of the Hedged\\nLiability\\n(Dollars in Millions) January 1, 2023 January 2, 2022 January 1, 2023 January 2, 2022\\nLong-term Debt $ 8,665 \\u00a0$ 9,793 \\u00a0$ ( 1,435 )$ ( 142 )\\n55 The following table is the e\\ufb00ect of derivatives not designated as hedging instrument for the \\ufb01scal years ended\\nJanuary\\u00a01, 2023 and January\\u00a02, 2022:\\n(Dollars in Millions)Location of Gain /(Loss)\\nRecognized in Income on\\nDerivativeGain/(Loss)\\nRecognized In\\nIncome on Derivative\\nDerivatives Not Designated as Hedging\\nInstruments January 1, 2023 January 2, 2022\\nForeign Exchange Contracts Other (income) expense $ 94 \\u00a0 ( 70 )\\nThe following table is the e\\ufb00ect of net investment hedges for the \\ufb01scal years ended January\\u00a01, 2023 and January\\u00a02,\\n2022:\\nGain/(Loss)\\nRecognized In\\nAccumulated OCILocation of Gain or (Loss)\\nReclassi\\ufb01ed from Accumulated\\nOther Comprehensive Income\\nInto IncomeGain/(Loss) Reclassi\\ufb01ed\\nFrom\\nAccumulated OCI\\nInto Income\\n(Dollars in Millions)January 1,\\n2023January 2,\\n2022January 1,\\n2023January 2,\\n2022\\nDebt $ 197 \\u00a0 387 \\u00a0Interest (income) expense \\u2014 \\u00a0 \\u2014 \\u00a0\\nCross Currency interest\\nrate swaps $ 766 \\u00a0 548 \\u00a0Interest (income) expense \\u2014 \\u00a0 \\u2014 \\u00a0\\nThe Company holds equity investments with readily determinable fair values and equity investments without\\nreadily determinable fair values.

In \\ufb01scal year 2021, the Company reorganized the ownership structure of certain\\nwholly-owned international subsidiaries. As part of this reorganization, the Company increased the tax basis of\\ncertain assets to fair value in accordance with applicable local regulations. The net impact of this restructuring was\\napproximately $ 0.6 \\u00a0billion net bene\\ufb01t or 2.7 % bene\\ufb01t to the Company\\u2019s annual e\\ufb00ective tax rate, comprised of\\nthe following items:\\n\\u2022approximately $ 2.3 \\u00a0billion of local deferred tax assets to record the remeasurement of the tax basis of\\nthese assets to fair value, this bene\\ufb01t has been re\\ufb02ected as \\u201cInternational Operations\\u201d on the Company\\u2019s\\ne\\ufb00ective tax rate reconciliation.\\n\\u2022approximately $ 1.7 \\u00a0billion of U.S. deferred tax expense relating to the GILTI deferred tax liability resulting\\nfrom the remeasurement of these deferred tax assets.

The Federal transitional provisions of TRAF allow companies, under certain conditions,\\nto adjust the tax basis in certain assets to fair value (i.e., \\u201cstep-up\\u201d) to be depreciated and amortized resulting in\\nan incremental Swiss tax deduction over the transitional period.\\nTRAF also provides for parameters which enable the Swiss cantons to establish localized tax rates and regulations\\nfor companies. The new cantonal tax parameters include favorable tax bene\\ufb01ts for patents and additional research\\nand development tax deductions. The cantonal transitional provisions of TRAF allowed companies to elect either 1)\\ntax basis step-up similar to the Federal transition bene\\ufb01t or 2) alternative statutory tax rate for a period not to\\nexceed 5 years. The Company has operations located in various Swiss cantons.\\nDuring the \\ufb01scal year 2020, the \\ufb01nal canton where the Company maintains signi\\ufb01cant operations enacted TRAF\\nlegislation. Additionally, the Company received rulings from the Swiss Federal and cantonal tax authorities in the\\nremaining jurisdictions where it has signi\\ufb01cant operations. These rulings resulted in the Company revising its\\nestimate on the tax basis adjustment (i.e., \\u201cstep-up\\u201d) for its assets and as a result, the Company recorded\\nadditional deferred tax bene\\ufb01ts in 2020. The Company recognized a net bene\\ufb01t in the \\ufb01scal year 2020 for Swiss Tax\\nReform of approximately $ 0.4 \\u00a0billion or 2.6 % bene\\ufb01t to the Company\\u2019s annual e\\ufb00ective tax rate, comprised of the\\nfollowing items:\\n\\u2022approximately $ 0.3 billion tax bene\\ufb01t relating to the remeasurement of Swiss deferred tax assets and\\nliabilities for the change in the Federal and cantonal tax rates, where enactment occurred in the \\ufb01scal year\\n2020; this bene\\ufb01t has been re\\ufb02ected as \\u201cInternational Operations\\u201d on the Company\\u2019s e\\ufb00ective tax rate\\nreconciliation.\\n\\u2022a $ 450 million deferred tax asset related to the estimated value of a Federal tax basis step-up of the\\nCompany\\u2019s Swiss subsidiaries\\u2019 assets as described above; this bene\\ufb01t has been re\\ufb02ected as \\u201cInternational\\nOperations\\u201d on the Company\\u2019s e\\ufb00ective tax rate reconciliation.\\n\\u2022approximately $ 0.3 billion of U.S. deferred tax expense relating to the GILTI deferred tax liability resulting\\nfrom the remeasurement of the Swiss deferred tax assets and liabilities in the \\ufb01scal year 2020.

In addition,\\nin the \\ufb01scal year 2020, the Company had lower income in higher tax jurisdictions, primarily driven by:\\n\\u2022the impact of the accrual of litigation costs related to talc for $ 4.0 \\u00a0billion which reduced the U.S. earnings\\nbefore taxes at an e\\ufb00ective tax rate of 23.5 %;\\n\\u2022the accrual of additional legal costs, including an additional $ 1.0 \\u00a0billion associated with a revised\\nagreement in principle to settle opioid litigation at an e\\ufb00ective tax rate of 21.4 %\\nThe Company also reduced the contingent consideration liability related to the Auris Health acquisition in 2019 and\\nreversed some of its unrecognized tax bene\\ufb01ts due to the completion of several years of tax examinations in\\ncertain jurisdictions during the \\ufb01scal year 2020.\\n63 Temporary di\\ufb00erences and carryforwards at the end of \\ufb01scal years 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\\n2022 Deferred T ax 2021 Deferred T ax\\n(Dollars in Millions) Asset Liability Asset Liability\\nEmployee related obligations $ 725 \\u00a0 1,244 \\u00a0\\nStock based compensation 687 \\u00a0 679 \\u00a0\\nDepreciation of property, plant and\\nequipment ( 858 ) ( 876 )\\nGoodwill and intangibles ( 4,271 ) ( 2,659 )\\nR&D capitalized for tax 2,611 \\u00a0 1,664 \\u00a0\\nReserves\\u00a0& liabilities 2,761 \\u00a0 2,882 \\u00a0\\nIncome reported for tax purposes 2,045 \\u00a0 2,566 \\u00a0\\nNet realizable operating loss\\ncarryforwards 1,260 \\u00a0 1,720 \\u00a0\\nUndistributed foreign earnings 1,565 \\u00a0 ( 1,693 ) 1,015 \\u00a0 ( 1,461 )\\nGlobal intangible low-taxed income ( 3,547 ) ( 4,853 )\\nMiscellaneous international 1,053 \\u00a0 ( 65 ) 870 \\u00a0 ( 39 )\\nMiscellaneous U.S.\\u00a0 476 \\u00a0 ( 16 )\\nTotal deferred income taxes $ 13,183 \\u00a0 ( 10,434 ) 12,640 \\u00a0 ( 9,904 )\\nCertain prior year amounts have been reclassi\\ufb01ed to conform to current year presentation.\\nAmount is inclusive of the $ 2.3 \\u00a0billion deferred tax asset established as part of the reorganized ownership\\nstructure of certain wholly-owned international subsidiaries, as previously described.\\n Amount is inclusive of the $ 1.8 \\u00a0billion deferred tax liability due to the acquisition of Abiomed.\\nNet of valuation allowances of $ 0.9 \\u00a0billion in both 2022 and 2021.\\nThe Company has wholly-owned international subsidiaries that have cumulative net losses.

However, the Company is\\nnot able to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of any other future tax payments or change in\\nuncertain tax positions, if any.\\nThe Company classi\\ufb01es liabilities for unrecognized tax bene\\ufb01ts and related interest and penalties as long-term\\nliabilities. Interest expense and penalties related to unrecognized tax bene\\ufb01ts are classi\\ufb01ed as income tax expense.\\nThe Company recognized after tax interest expense of $ 139 million, $ 44 million and $ 32 million in \\ufb01scal years\\n2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Pensions and Other Bene\\ufb01t Plans\\nThe Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including de\\ufb01ned bene\\ufb01t, de\\ufb01ned contribution and\\ntermination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. The Company also provides post-retirement\\nbene\\ufb01ts, primarily healthcare, to all eligible U.S.\\u00a0retired employees and their dependents.\\nMany international employees are covered by government-sponsored programs and the cost to the Company is not\\nsigni\\ufb01cant.\\nIn the U.S, non-union pension bene\\ufb01ts for employees hired before January 1, 2015 are primarily based on the\\nemployee\\u2019s compensation during the last \\ufb01ve years before retirement and the number of years of service (the Final\\nAverage Pay formula). U.S. pension bene\\ufb01ts for employees hired after 2014, are calculated using a di\\ufb00erent formula\\nbased on employee compensation over total years of service (the Retirement Value formula).\\nIn January 2021, the Company announced that, e\\ufb00ective on January 1, 2026, all eligible U.S. non-union employees,\\nregardless of hire date, will earn bene\\ufb01ts under the Retirement Value formula.

Fair value is based upon\\nquoted market prices, where available.

Other investments are through investment vehicles\\nvalued using the NAV provided by the administrator of the fund. The NAV is a quoted price in a market that\\nis not active and classi\\ufb01ed as Level\\u00a02.\\n\\u2022Government and agency securities\\u00a0\\u2014 A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price\\nreported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded. Where quoted prices are\\navailable in an active market, the investments are classi\\ufb01ed within Level\\u00a01 of the valuation hierarchy. If\\nquoted market prices are not available for the speci\\ufb01c security, then fair values are estimated by using\\npricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash \\ufb02ows. When\\nquoted market prices for a security are not available in an active market, they are classi\\ufb01ed as Level\\u00a02.\\n\\u2022Debt instruments\\u00a0\\u2014 A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported on the\\nmajor market on which the individual securities are traded. Where quoted prices are available in an active\\nmarket, the investments are classi\\ufb01ed as Level\\u00a01. If quoted market prices are not available for the speci\\ufb01c\\nsecurity, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar\\ncharacteristics or discounted cash \\ufb02ows and are classi\\ufb01ed as Level\\u00a02. Level\\u00a03 debt instruments are priced\\nbased on unobservable inputs.\\n\\u2022Equity securities\\u00a0\\u2014 Equity securities are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which\\nthe individual securities are traded. Substantially all equity securities are classi\\ufb01ed within Level\\u00a01 of the\\nvaluation hierarchy.\\n\\u2022Commingled funds\\u00a0\\u2014 These investment vehicles are valued using the NAV provided by the fund\\nadministrator.

International Currency Translation\\nFor translation of its subsidiaries operating in non-U.S.\\u00a0Dollar currencies, the Company has determined that the\\nlocal currencies of its international subsidiaries are the functional currencies except those in highly in\\ufb02ationary\\neconomies, which are de\\ufb01ned as those which have had compound cumulative rates of in\\ufb02ation of 100% or more\\nduring the past three years, or where a substantial portion of its cash \\ufb02ows are not in the local currency. For the\\nmajority of the Company's subsidiaries the local currency is the functional currency.\\nIn consolidating international subsidiaries, balance sheet currency e\\ufb00ects are recorded as a component of\\naccumulated other comprehensive income. The other current and non-current assets line within the Statement of\\nCash \\ufb02ows includes the impact of foreign currency translation. This equity account includes the results of\\ntranslating certain balance sheet assets and liabilities at current exchange rates and some accounts at historical\\nrates, except for those located in highly in\\ufb02ationary economies, (Argentina and Venezuela). Beginning in the \\ufb01scal\\nsecond quarter of 2022, the Company also accounted for operations in Turkey as highly in\\ufb02ationary. The translation\\nof balance sheet accounts for highly in\\ufb02ationary economies are re\\ufb02ected in the operating results.\\nA rollforward of the changes during \\ufb01scal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 for foreign currency translation\\nadjustments is included in Note\\u00a013.\\nNet currency transaction gains and losses included in Other (income) expense were losses of $ 328 million, $\\n236 million and $ 209 million in \\ufb01scal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\\n15.

Common Stock, Stock Option Plans and Stock Compensation Agreements\\nAt January\\u00a01, 2023, the Company had one stock-based compensation plan. The shares outstanding are for contracts\\nunder the Company's 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan and the 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The 2012 Long-Term\\nIncentive Plan expired on April 26, 2022. All awards (stock options, restricted shares units and performance share\\nunits) granted subsequent to that date were under the 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan. Under the 2022 Long-Term\\nIncentive Plan, the Company may issue up to 150 \\u00a0million shares of common stock, of which up to 110 \\u00a0million\\nshares of common stock may be issued subject to stock options or stock appreciation rights and up to 40 \\u00a0million\\nshares of common stock may be issued subject to full value awards. Awards will generally be counted on a 1-for-1\\nbasis against the share reserve, provided that if more than 40 \\u00a0million full value awards are granted, each full value\\naward in excess of 40 \\u00a0million will be counted on a 5-for-1 basis against the share reserve. Shares available for\\nfuture grants under the 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan were 150 million at the end of \\ufb01scal year 2022.\\nThe compensation cost that has been charged against income for these plans was $ 1,138 million, $ 1,135\\nmillion and $ 1,005 million for \\ufb01scal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The total income tax bene\\ufb01t\\nrecognized in the income statement for share-based compensation costs was $ 196 million, $ 218 million and $ 210\\nmillion for \\ufb01scal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company also recognized additional income tax\\nbene\\ufb01ts of $ 282 \\u00a0million, $ 223 \\u00a0million and $ 248 \\u00a0million for \\ufb01scal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, for\\nwhich options were exercised or restricted shares were vested. The total unrecognized compensation cost was $\\n939 million, $ 862 million and $ 804 million for \\ufb01scal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The weighted\\naverage period for this cost to be recognized was 1.80 \\u00a0years, 1.78 \\u00a0years and 1.76 \\u00a0years for \\ufb01scal years 2022,\\n2021, and 2020, respectively. Share-based compensation costs capitalized as part of inventory were insigni\\ufb01cant in\\nall periods.\\nThe Company settles employee bene\\ufb01t equity issuances with treasury shares. Treasury shares are replenished\\nthrough market purchases throughout the year for the number of shares used to settle employee bene\\ufb01t equity\\nissuances. 72 Stock Options\\nStock options expire 10 \\u00a0years from the date of grant and vest over service periods that range from 6 months to 4\\nyears. All options are granted at the average of the high and low prices of the Company\\u2019s Common Stock on the\\nNew York Stock Exchange on the date of grant.\\nThe fair value of each option award was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation\\nmodel that uses the assumptions noted in the following table. For 2022, 2021, and 2020 grants, expected volatility\\nrepresents a blended rate of 10-year weekly historical overall volatility rate, and a 5-week average implied volatility\\nrate based on at-the-money traded Johnson\\u00a0& Johnson options with a life of 2\\u00a0years. For all grants, historical data is\\nused to determine the expected life of the option. The risk-free rate was based on the U.S.\\u00a0Treasury yield curve in\\ne\\ufb00ect at the time of grant.\\nThe average fair value of options granted was $ 23.23 , $ 20.86 and $ 16.42 , in \\ufb01scal years 2022, 2021 and 2020,\\nrespectively.

Acquisitions and Divestitures\\nDuring the \\ufb01scal year 2022, certain businesses were acquired for $ 17.7 \\u00a0billion in cash and $ 1.1 \\u00a0billion of\\nliabilities assumed. These acquisitions were accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, results of\\noperations have been included in the \\ufb01nancial statements from their respective dates of acquisition.\\nThe excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $ 17.3 \\u00a0billion\\nand has been assigned to identi\\ufb01able intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill.\\nThe \\ufb01scal year 2022 acquisitions primarily included Abiomed, Inc. (Abiomed). The remaining acquisitions were\\nnot material.\\nOn December 22, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of Abiomed, a leading, \\ufb01rst-to-market provider\\nof cardiovascular medical technology with a \\ufb01rst-in-kind portfolio for the treatment of coronary artery disease and\\nheart failure which also has an extensive innovation pipeline of life-saving technologies. The transaction broadens\\nthe Company\\u2019s position as a growing cardiovascular innovator, advancing the standard of care in heart failure and\\nrecovery, one of healthcare\\u2019s largest areas of unmet need. The transaction was accounted for as a business\\ncombination and the results of operations were included in the MedTech segment as of the date of the acquisition.\\nThe acquisition was completed through a tender o\\ufb00er for all outstanding shares. The consideration paid in the\\nacquisition consisted of an upfront payment of $ 380.00 per share in cash, amounting to $ 17.1 \\u00a0billion, net of cash\\nacquired, as well as a non-tradeable contingent value right (\\u201cCVR\\u201d) entitling the holder to receive up to $ 35.00 per\\nshare in cash (which with respect to the CVRs total approximately $ 1.6 \\u00a0billion in the aggregate) if certain\\ncommercial and clinical milestones are achieved. The corresponding enterprise value (without taking into account\\nthe CVRs) of approximately $ 16.5 \\u00a0billion includes cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities acquired.\\nThe milestones of the CVR consist of:\\na.$ 17.50 per share, payable if net sales for Abiomed products exceeds $ 3.7 \\u00a0billion during Johnson &\\nJohnson\\u2019s \\ufb01scal second quarter of 2027 through \\ufb01scal \\ufb01rst quarter of 2028, or if this threshold is not met\\nduring this period and is subsequently met during any rolling four quarter period up to the end of Johnson &\\nJohnson\\u2019s \\ufb01scal \\ufb01rst quarter of 2029, $ 8.75 per share;\\nb.$ 7.50 per share payable upon FDA premarket application approval of the use of Impella products in ST-\\nelevated myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients without cardiogenic shock by January 1, 2028; and\\nc.$ 10.00 per share payable upon the \\ufb01rst publication of a Class I recommendation for the use of Impella\\nproducts in high risk PCI or STEMI with or without cardiogenic shock within four years from their respective\\nclinical endpoint publication dates, but in all cases no later than December 31, 2029.\\nThe fair value of the acquisition was allocated to assets acquired of $ 19.9 \\u00a0billion (net of $ 0.3 \\u00a0billion cash\\nacquired), primarily to goodwill for $ 10.9 \\u00a0billion, amortizable intangible assets for $ 6.6 \\u00a0billion, IPR&D for $ 1.1\\n\\u00a0billion, marketable(5)\\n(6)\\n\\u00ae\\n\\u00ae\\n82  securities of $ 0.6 \\u00a0billion and liabilities assumed of $ 2.8 \\u00a0billion, which includes the fair value of the contingent\\nconsideration mentioned above for $ 0.7 \\u00a0billion and deferred taxes of $ 1.8 \\u00a0billion. The goodwill is primarily\\nattributable to the commercial acceleration and expansion of the portfolio and is not expected to be deductible for\\ntax purposes. The contingent consideration was recorded in Other Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\\nAs the acquisition occurred in December 2022, the Company is still \\ufb01nalizing the allocation of the purchase\\nprice to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The allocation of the purchase price included in the\\ncurrent period balance sheet is based on the best estimate of management and is preliminary and subject to\\nchange. To assist management in the allocation, the Company engaged valuation specialists to prepare appraisals.\\nThe Company will \\ufb01nalize the amounts recognized as the information necessary to complete the analysis is\\nobtained. The Company expects to \\ufb01nalize these amounts as soon as possible but no later than one year from the\\nacquisition date.\\nThe amortizable intangible assets were primarily comprised of already in-market products of the Impella\\nplatform with an average weighted life of 14 years. The IPR&D assets were valued for technology programs for\\nunapproved products. The value of the IPR&D was calculated using probability-adjusted cash \\ufb02ow projections\\ndiscounted for the risk inherent in such projects. The probability of success factor ranged from 52 % to 70 %. The\\ndiscount rate applied was 9.5 %.\\nIn 2022, the Company recorded acquisition related costs before tax of approximately $ 0.3 \\u00a0billion, which was\\nrecorded in Other (income)/expense.\\nDuring \\ufb01scal year 2021, the Company did not make any material acquisitions.\\nDuring \\ufb01scal year 2020, certain businesses were acquired for $ 7.3 \\u00a0billion in cash and $ 0.4 \\u00a0billion of liabilities\\nassumed. These acquisitions were accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, results of\\noperations have been included in the \\ufb01nancial statements from their respective dates of acquisition.\\nThe excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $ 7.5\\n\\u00a0billion and has been assigned to identi\\ufb01able intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill.\\nThe \\ufb01scal year 2020 acquisitions primarily included: all rights to the investigational compound bermekimab,\\nwhich has multiple dermatological indications, along with certain employees from XBiotech Inc. (XBiotech),\\nMomenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Momenta), a company that discovers and develops novel therapies for immune-\\nmediated diseases and the outstanding shares in Verb Surgical Inc., a company with signi\\ufb01cant robotics and data\\nscience capabilities.\\nDuring the \\ufb01scal \\ufb01rst quarter of 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of all rights to the investigational\\ncompound bermekimab, which has multiple dermatological indications, along with certain employees from\\nXBiotech Inc., for a purchase price of $ 0.8 \\u00a0billion. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated primarily to non-\\namortizable intangible assets, primarily IPR&D, for $ 0.8 \\u00a0billion applying a probability of success factor that ranged\\nfrom 20 % to 60 % to re\\ufb02ect inherent development, regulatory and commercial risk for the di\\ufb00erent indications.\\nThe discount rate applied was approximately 16 %. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination\\nand included in the Pharmaceutical segment. In \\ufb01scal 2022, the Company recorded an intangible asset impairment\\ncharge of approximately $ 0.8 \\u00a0billion related to this in-process research and development asset.\\nAdditionally, in the \\ufb01scal \\ufb01rst quarter of 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of all outstanding shares\\nin Verb Surgical Inc., a company with signi\\ufb01cant robotics and data science capabilities, including those shares\\npreviously held by Verily. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination and included in the\\nMedTech segment. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated primarily to non-amortizable intangible assets,\\nprimarily IPR&D, for $ 0.4 \\u00a0billion, goodwill for $ 0.2 \\u00a0billion, other assets of $ 0.2 \\u00a0billion and liabilities assumed of $\\n0.3 \\u00a0billion. The fair value of the Company's previously held equity investment in Verb Surgical Inc. was $ 0.4\\n\\u00a0billion.\\nOn October 1, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of Momenta for a purchase price of approximately\\n$ 6.1 \\u00a0billion, net of cash acquired. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated primarily to non-amortizable\\nintangible assets (IPR&D) of $ 6.0 \\u00a0billion, goodwill of $ 1.2 \\u00a0billion, other assets of $ 0.5 \\u00a0billion and liabilities of $\\n1.6 \\u00a0billion. The assets acquired are intended to address substantial unmet medical need in maternal-fetal\\ndisorders, neuro-in\\ufb02ammatory disorders, rheumatology, dermatology and autoimmune hematology. Depending on\\nthe asset, probability of success factors ranging from 20 % to 77 % were used in the fair value calculation to re\\ufb02ect\\ninherent development and regulatory risk of the IPR&D. The discount rate applied was approximately 13 %. The\\ngoodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the business acquisition and is not expected to\\nbe deductible for tax purposes. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination and included in the\\nPharmaceutical segment.\\nIn accordance with U.S.\\u00a0GAAP standards related to business combinations, and goodwill and other intangible\\nassets, supplemental pro forma information for \\ufb01scal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 is not provided, as the impact of\\nthe aforementioned acquisitions did not have a material e\\ufb00ect on the Company\\u2019s results of operations.\\nDivestitures\\nDuring \\ufb01scal year 2022, the Company did not make any material divestitures.\\nDuring \\ufb01scal year 2021, in separate transactions, the Company divested two brands outside the U.S. within the\\nPharmaceutical segment. The Company recognized a pre-tax gain recorded in Other (income) expense, net, of\\napproximately $ 0.6 \\u00a0billion.\\u00ae\\n83  During \\ufb01scal year 2020, the Company sold 11.8 \\u00a0million shares of Idorsia LTD (Idorsia), or its 8.3 % ownership in\\nthe company at that time. The transaction resulted in gross proceeds of approximately CHF 337 \\u00a0million ($ 357\\n\\u00a0million) based on a sales price of CHF 28.55 /share and resulted in an immaterial net loss. At the end of \\ufb01scal\\n2020, the Company had rights to approximately 38.7 \\u00a0million shares through a convertible loan with a principal\\namount of CHF 445 \\u00a0million (due June 2027). During \\ufb01scal year 2021, the Company converted CHF 110 \\u00a0million ($\\n120 \\u00a0million) of this loan into approximately 9.6 \\u00a0million shares of Idorsia which were re\\ufb02ected at fair value as of\\nJanuary 2, 2022. During the \\ufb01scal third quarter of 2021, the Company's undrawn credit facility with Idorsia was\\nterminated.\\n19. Legal Proceedings\\nJohnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product\\nliability; intellectual property; commercial; indemni\\ufb01cation and other matters; governmental investigations; and\\nother legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of their business.\\nThe Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a\\nliability will be incurred, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of January 1, 2023, the\\nCompany has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be\\nreasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal\\nissue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in\\naccordance with ASC 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a\\nloss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss\\nbeyond the amounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of\\njudgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing\\nof related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be a\\ufb00ected by various factors\\nincluding, among other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate;\\nscienti\\ufb01c and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters\\npresent legal uncertainties; there are signi\\ufb01cant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty\\nand unpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements;\\ncomplexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. To the extent\\nadverse awards, judgments or verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an\\naccrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.\\nIn the Company\\u2019s opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with\\ncounsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company\\u2019s balance sheet, is not\\nexpected to have a material adverse e\\ufb00ect on the Company\\u2019s \\ufb01nancial position. However, the resolution of, or\\nincrease in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse e\\ufb00ect\\non the Company\\u2019s results of operations and cash \\ufb02ows for that period.\\nPRODUCT LIABILITY\\nThe Company and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous product liability claims and lawsuits involving\\nmultiple products. Claimants in these cases seek substantial compensatory and, where available, punitive\\ndamages. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome\\nof litigation. From time to time, even if it has substantial defenses, the Company considers isolated settlements\\nbased on a variety of circumstances. The Company has established accruals for product liability claims and lawsuits\\nin compliance with ASC 450-20 based on currently available information, which in some cases may be limited. The\\nCompany accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when those costs are\\nprobable and can be reasonably estimated. For certain of these matters, the Company has accrued additional\\namounts such as estimated costs associated with settlements, damages and other losses. Product liability accruals\\ncan represent projected product liability for thousands of claims around the world, each in di\\ufb00erent litigation\\nenvironments and with di\\ufb00erent fact patterns. Changes to the accruals may be required in the future as additional\\ninformation becomes available.\\nThe most signi\\ufb01cant of these cases include: the DePuy ASR XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR Hip Resurfacing\\nSystem; the PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System; pelvic meshes; RISPERDAL; body powders containing talc, primarily\\nJOHNSON'S Baby Powder; ETHICON PHYSIOMESHFlexible Composite Mesh; ELMIRON; and TYLENOL. As of January\\u00a01,\\n2023, in the United States there were approximately 170 plainti\\ufb00s with direct claims in pending lawsuits regarding\\ninjuries allegedly due to the DePuy ASR XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR Hip Resurfacing System; 1,400 with\\nrespect to the PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System; 9,000 with respect to pelvic meshes; 1,100 with respect to\\nRISPERDAL; 40,300 with respect to body powders containing talc;2,100 with respect to ETHICON PHYSIOMESH\\nFlexible Composite Mesh; 2,000 with respect to ELMIRON; and 170 with respect to TYLENOL. The number of\\npending lawsuits is expected to \\ufb02uctuate as certain lawsuits are settled or dismissed and additional lawsuits are\\n\\ufb01led. \\n  84 In August 2010, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. (DePuy) announced a worldwide voluntary recall of its ASR XL Acetabular\\nSystem and DePuy ASR Hip Resurfacing System (ASR Hip) used in hip replacement surgery. Claims for personal\\ninjury have been made against DePuy and the Company. Cases \\ufb01led in federal courts in the United States have\\nbeen organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio.\\nLitigation has also been \\ufb01led in countries outside of the United States, primarily in the United Kingdom, Canada,\\nAustralia, Ireland, Germany, India and Italy. In November 2013, DePuy reached an agreement with a Court-\\nappointed committee of lawyers representing ASR Hip plainti\\ufb00s to establish a program to settle claims with eligible\\nASR Hip patients in the United States who had surgery to replace their ASR Hips, known as revision surgery, as of\\nAugust 2013. DePuy reached additional agreements in February 2015 and March 2017, which further extended the\\nsettlement program to include ASR Hip patients who had revision surgeries after August 2013 and prior to February\\n15, 2017. This settlement program has resolved more than 10,000 claims, thereby bringing to resolution signi\\ufb01cant\\nASR Hip litigation activity in the United States. However, lawsuits in the United States remain, and the settlement\\nprogram does not address litigation outside of the United States. In Australia, a class action settlement was\\nreached that resolved the claims of the majority of ASR Hip patients in that country. In Canada, the Company has\\nreached agreements to settle the class actions \\ufb01led in that country. The Company continues to receive information\\nwith respect to potential additional costs associated with this recall on a worldwide basis. The Company has\\nestablished accruals for the costs associated with the United States settlement program and ASR Hip-related\\nproduct liability litigation.\\nClaims for personal injury have also been made against DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. and the Company (collectively,\\nDePuy) relating to the PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System used in hip replacement surgery. Product liability lawsuits\\ncontinue to be \\ufb01led, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the\\nanticipated number of cases. Most cases \\ufb01led in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-\\ndistrict litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas (Texas MDL). Beginning on June\\n1, 2022, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation ceased transfer of new cases into the Texas MDL, and there are\\nnow cases pending in federal court outside the Texas MDL. Litigation also has been \\ufb01led in state courts and in\\ncountries outside of the United States. Prior to 2019, several adverse verdicts had been rendered against DePuy,\\none of which was reversed on appeal and remanded for retrial. During the \\ufb01rst quarter of 2019, DePuy established\\na United States settlement program to resolve these cases. As part of the settlement program, adverse verdicts\\nhave been settled. The Company has established an accrual for product liability litigation associated with the\\nPINNACLE Acetabular Cup System and the related settlement program.\\nClaims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and the Company arising out of Ethicon\\u2019s\\npelvic mesh devices used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. The Company continues to\\nreceive information with respect to potential costs and additional cases. Cases \\ufb01led in federal courts in the United\\nStates had been organized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the Southern\\nDistrict of West Virginia. In March 2021, the MDL Court entered an order closing the MDL. The MDL Court has\\nremanded cases for trial to the jurisdictions where the case was originally \\ufb01led and additional pelvic mesh lawsuits\\nhave been \\ufb01led, and remain, outside of the MDL. The Company has settled or otherwise resolved the majority of\\nthe United States cases and the estimated costs associated with these settlements and the remaining cases are\\nre\\ufb02ected in the Company\\u2019s accruals. In addition, class actions and individual personal injury cases or claims\\nseeking damages for alleged injury resulting from Ethicon\\u2019s pelvic mesh devices have been commenced in various\\ncountries outside of the United States, including claims and cases in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands,\\nBelgium, France, Ireland, Italy, Spain and Slovenia and class actions in Israel, Australia, Canada and South Africa. In\\nNovember 2019, the Federal Court of Australia issued a judgment regarding its \\ufb01ndings with respect to liability in\\nrelation to the three Lead Applicants and generally in relation to the design, manufacture, pre and post-market\\nassessments and testing, and supply and promotion of the devices in Australia used to treat stress urinary\\nincontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. In September 2022, after exhausting its appeals, the Company reached an\\nin-principle agreement to resolve the two pelvic mesh class actions in Australia, pending Federal Court approval. In\\nNovember 2022, the application for approval of the settlement was \\ufb01led, and a hearing on the settlement has been\\nscheduled for the end of February 2023. The class actions in Canada were discontinued in 2020 as a result of a\\nsettlement of a group of cases and an agreement to resolve the Israeli class action was reached in May 2021. The\\nparties in the Israeli class action are currently \\ufb01nalizing the terms of the settlement. A motion to approve the\\nsettlement was \\ufb01led with the Court. The Company has established accruals with respect to product liability\\nlitigation associated with Ethicon\\u2019s pelvic mesh products.\\nFollowing a June 2016 worldwide market withdrawal of ETHICON PHYSIOMESH Flexible Composite Mesh\\n(Physiomesh), claims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and the Company alleging\\npersonal injury arising out of the use of this hernia mesh device. Cases \\ufb01led in federal courts in the United States\\nhave been organized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the Northern District\\nof Georgia. A multi-county litigation (MCL) also has been formed in New Jersey state court and assigned to Atlantic\\nCounty for cases pending in New Jersey. In addition to the matters in the MDL and MCL, there are additional\\nlawsuits pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District 85 of Ohio, which are part of the MDL for polypropylene mesh devices manufactured by C.R. Bard, Inc., and lawsuits\\npending in two New Jersey MCLs formed for Proceed/Proceed Ventral Patch and Prolene Hernia systems, and\\nlawsuits pending outside the United States. In May 2021, Ethicon and lead counsel for the plainti\\ufb00s entered into a\\nterm sheet to resolve approximately 3,600 Physiomesh cases (covering approximately 4,300 plainti\\ufb00s) pending in\\nthe MDL and MCL at that time. A master settlement agreement (MSA) was entered into in September 2021 and\\nincludes 3,729 cases in the MDL and MCL. All deadlines and trial settings in those proceedings are currently stayed\\npending the completion of the settlement agreement. Of the cases subject to the MSA, 2,236 have been dismissed\\nwith prejudice. Post-settlement cases in the Physiomesh MDL and MCL are subject to docket control orders\\nrequiring early expert reports and discovery requirements. As of January 2023, there are approximately 208 active\\ncases subject to these orders which are being reviewed and evaluated.\\nClaims have also been \\ufb01led against Ethicon and the Company alleging personal injuries arising from the PROCEED\\nMesh and PROCEED Ventral Patch hernia mesh products. In March 2019, the New Jersey Supreme Court entered an\\norder consolidating these cases pending in New Jersey as an MCL in Atlantic County Superior Court. Additional\\ncases have been \\ufb01led in various federal and state courts in the United States, and in jurisdictions outside the\\nUnited States.\\nEthicon and the Company also have been subject to claims for personal injuries arising from the PROLENE\\nPolypropylene Hernia System. In January 2020, the New Jersey Supreme Court created an MCL in Atlantic County\\nSuperior Court to handle such cases. Cases involving this product have also been \\ufb01led in other federal and state\\ncourts in the United States.\\nIn October 2022, an agreement in principle, subject to various conditions, was reached to settle the majority of the\\npending cases involving Proceed, Proceed Ventral Patch, Prolene Hernia System and related multi-layered mesh\\nproducts. All litigation activities in the two New Jersey MCLs are stayed pending resolution of the proposed\\nsettlement. Future cases that are \\ufb01led in the New Jersey MCLs will be subject to docket control orders requiring\\nearly expert reports and discovery requirements.\\nThe Company has established accruals with respect to product liability litigation associated with ETHICON\\nPHYSIOMESH Flexible Composite Mesh, PROCEED Mesh and PROCEED Ventral Patch, and PROLENE Polypropylene\\nHernia System products.\\nClaims for personal injury have been made against Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and the Company arising out of\\nthe use of RISPERDAL, and related compounds, indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia, acute manic or mixed\\nepisodes associated with bipolar I disorder and irritability associated with autism. Lawsuits primarily have been\\n\\ufb01led in state courts in Pennsylvania, California, and Missouri. Other actions are pending in various courts in the\\nUnited States and Canada. Product liability lawsuits continue to be \\ufb01led, and the Company continues to receive\\ninformation with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. The Company has successfully\\ndefended a number of these cases but there have been verdicts against the Company, including a verdict in\\nOctober 2019 of $ 8.0 \\u00a0billion of punitive damages related to one plainti\\ufb00, which the trial judge reduced to $ 6.8\\n\\u00a0million in January 2020. In September 2021, the Company entered into a settlement in principle with the counsel\\nrepresenting plainti\\ufb00s in this matter and in substantially all of the outstanding cases in the United States. The costs\\nassociated with this and other settlements are re\\ufb02ected in the Company\\u2019s accruals.\\nClaims for personal injury arising out of the use of XARELTO, an oral anticoagulant, have been made against\\nJanssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI); the Company; and JPI\\u2019s collaboration partner for XARELTO, Bayer Healthcare AG,\\nand certain of its a\\ufb03liates. Cases \\ufb01led in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district\\nlitigation in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. In addition, cases were \\ufb01led in\\nstate courts across the United States. Many of these cases were consolidated into a state mass tort litigation in\\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania and in a coordinated proceeding in Los Angeles, California. Class action lawsuits also\\nhave been \\ufb01led in Canada. In March 2019, JPI and the Company announced an agreement in principle to settle the\\nXARELTO cases in the United States; the settlement agreement was executed in May 2019, the settlement became\\n\\ufb01nal in December 2019, and the settlement was funded in January 2020. This resolved the majority of cases\\npending in the United States. The Company has established accruals for its costs associated with the United States\\nsettlement program and XARELTO related product liability litigation.\\nA signi\\ufb01cant number of personal injury claims alleging that talc causes cancer were made against Johnson &\\nJohnson Consumer Inc. and the Company arising out of the use of body powders containing talc, primarily\\nJOHNSON\\u2019S Baby Powder. The number of these personal injury lawsuits, \\ufb01led in state and federal courts in the\\nUnited States as well as outside of the United States, continued to increase.\\nIn talc cases that previously have gone to trial, the Company has obtained a number of defense verdicts, but there\\nalso have been verdicts against the Company, many of which have been reversed on appeal. In June 2020, the\\nMissouri Court of Appeals reversed in part and a\\ufb03rmed in part a July 2018 verdict of $ 4.7 \\u00a0billion in Ingham v. Johnson & Johnson, et al., No. ED 207476 (Mo. App.), reducing the overall award to $ 2.1 \\u00a0billion. An application for\\ntransfer of the case to the Missouri Supreme Court\\n86 was subsequently denied and in June 2021, a petition for certiorari, seeking a review of the Ingham decision by the\\nUnited States Supreme Court, was denied. In June 2021, the Company paid the award, which, including interest,\\ntotaled approximately $ 2.5 \\u00a0billion. The facts and circumstances, including the terms of the award, were unique to\\nthe Ingham decision and not representative of other claims brought against the Company. The Company continues\\nto believe that it has strong legal grounds to contest the other talc verdicts that it has appealed. Notwithstanding\\nthe Company\\u2019s con\\ufb01dence in the safety of its talc products, in certain circumstances the Company has settled\\ncases.\\nIn October 2021, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. (Old JJCI) implemented a corporate restructuring (the 2021\\nCorporate Restructuring). As a result of that restructuring, Old JJCI ceased to exist and three new entities were\\ncreated: (a) LTL Management LLC, a North Carolina limited liability company (LTL or Debtor); (b) Royalty A&M LLC, a\\nNorth Carolina limited liability company and a direct subsidiary of LTL (RAM); and (c) the Debtor\\u2019s direct parent,\\nJohnson & Johnson Consumer Inc., a New Jersey company (New JJCI). The Debtor received certain of Old JJCI\\u2019s assets\\nand became solely responsible for the talc-related liabilities of Old JJCI, including all liabilities related in any way to\\ninjury or damage, or alleged injury or damage, sustained or incurred in the purchase or use of, or exposure to, talc,\\nincluding talc contained in any product, or to the risk of, or responsibility for, any such damage or injury, except for\\nany liabilities for which the exclusive remedy is provided under a workers\\u2019 compensation statute or act (the Talc-\\nRelated Liabilities).\\nIn October 2021, notwithstanding the Company\\u2019s con\\ufb01dence in the safety of its talc products, the Debtor \\ufb01led a\\nvoluntary petition with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of North Carolina, Charlotte\\nDivision, seeking relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the LTL Bankruptcy Case). As a result of the LTL\\nBankruptcy Case, the North Carolina Bankruptcy Court entered a temporary restraining order staying all litigation\\nagainst LTL and Old JJCI. On November 15, 2021, the North Carolina Bankruptcy Court con\\ufb01rmed the scope of the\\nstay, issuing a Preliminary Injunction (PI) prohibiting and enjoining the commencement and prosecution of talc-\\nrelated claims against LTL, Old JJCI, New JJCI, the Company, other of their corporate a\\ufb03liates, identi\\ufb01ed retailers,\\ninsurance companies, and certain other parties (the Protected Parties). The LTL Bankruptcy Case was transferred to\\nthe United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey in November 2021, and that court extended the PI\\nthrough the end of February 2022. Claimants \\ufb01led motions to dismiss the LTL Bankruptcy Case and, following a\\nmultiple day hearing, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court denied those motions by order issued in March 2022. The\\nNew Jersey Bankruptcy Court simultaneously issued another order extending the stay as to the Protected Parties.\\nThe claimants subsequently \\ufb01led notices of appeal as to the denial of the motions to dismiss and the extension of\\nthe stay. In May 2022, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals granted the petitions to appeal. The brie\\ufb01ng and oral\\nargument on the appeal were completed in September 2022. On January 30, 2023, the Third Circuit reversed the\\nBankruptcy Court\\u2019s ruling and remanded to the Bankruptcy Court to dismiss the LTL bankruptcy. LTL \\ufb01led a petition\\nfor rehearing on the decision.\\nWhile the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court\\u2019s order e\\ufb00ectively stays all of the Company\\u2019s talc-related personal injury\\nlitigation, LTL has agreed to lift the stay on a small number of appeals where appeal bonds have been \\ufb01led.\\nThe Company has agreed to provide funding to LTL for the payment of amounts the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court\\ndetermines are owed by LTL and the establishment of a $ 2 \\u00a0billion trust in furtherance of this purpose. The\\nCompany has established a reserve for approximately $ 2 \\u00a0billion in connection with the aforementioned trust. After\\nand as a result of the \\ufb01ling of the LTL Bankruptcy Case, the Company de-consolidated LTL, which is a related party.\\nThe impact of the de-consolidation is not material to the Company. The parties have not yet reached a resolution of\\nall talc matters in the LTL Bankruptcy Case, and the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of\\nloss beyond the amount accrued.\\nA class action advancing claims relating to industrial talc was \\ufb01led against the Company and others in New Jersey\\nstate court in May 2022 (the Edley Class Action). The Edley Class Action asserts, among other things, that the\\nCompany fraudulently defended past asbestos personal injury lawsuits arising from exposure to industrial talc\\nmined, milled, and manufactured before January 6, 1989 by the Company\\u2019s then wholly owned subsidiary, Windsor\\nMinerals, Inc., which is currently a debtor in the Imerys Bankruptcy described hereafter. The Company removed the\\nEdley Class Action to federal court in the District of New Jersey. In July 2022, Imerys \\ufb01led a motion in the Imerys\\nBankruptcy to stay the Edley Class Action, which was denied in August 2022. In October 2022, the Company \\ufb01led\\nmotions to dismiss and to deny certi\\ufb01cation of a class to pursue the Edley Class Action in the New Jersey District\\nCourt.\\nIn February 2019, the Company\\u2019s talc supplier, Imerys Talc America, Inc. and two of its a\\ufb03liates, Imerys Talc\\nVermont, Inc. and Imerys Talc Canada, Inc. (collectively, Imerys) \\ufb01led a voluntary petition under chapter 11 of the\\nUnited States Code (the Bankruptcy Code) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware\\n(Imerys Bankruptcy). The Imerys Bankruptcy relates to Imerys\\u2019s potential liability for personal injury from exposure\\nto talcum powder sold by Imerys. In its bankruptcy, Imerys alleges it has claims against the Company for\\nindemni\\ufb01cation and rights to joint insurance proceeds. In May 2020, Imerys, its parent Imerys S.A., the Tort Claimants\\u2019 Committee (TCC), and the Future Claimants\\u2019 Representative (FCR) (collectively, the Plan Proponents)\\n\\ufb01led their Plan of Reorganization (the Plan) and the Disclosure Statement related\\n87 thereto. The Plan Proponents have since \\ufb01led numerous amendments to the Plan and Disclosure Statement. A\\nhearing on the Plan Proponent\\u2019s Disclosure Statement was held in January 2021, and the Court entered an order\\napproving the Disclosure Statement, allowing Imerys to proceed with soliciting votes on the Plan.\\nIn March 2021, the Company voted to reject the Plan and opted out of the consensual releases in the Plan. In April\\n2021, the Plan Proponents announced the Plan had received the requisite number of accepting votes to con\\ufb01rm the\\nPlan. The Company challenged certain improprieties with respect to portions of the vote and sought to disqualify\\nthose votes. In October 2021, the Bankruptcy Court issued a ruling deeming thousands of votes as withdrawn.\\nIn October 2021, Imerys cancelled the con\\ufb01rmation hearing on the Plan. Imerys, the TCC, the FCR, certain of\\nImerys\\u2019s insurers, and certain parties in the Cyprus Mines chapter 11 case (described below) (collectively the\\nMediation Parties) agreed to engage in mediation. The most recent term of the mediation ended on December 31,\\n2022.\\nIn July 2021, Imerys commenced an adversary proceeding against the Company in the Imerys Bankruptcy (the\\nImerys Adversary Proceeding). The Imerys Adversary Proceeding sought, among other things, certain declarations\\nwith respect to the indemni\\ufb01cation obligations allegedly owed by the Company to Imerys. The TCC and FCR\\nsimultaneously \\ufb01led a motion for temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin the\\nCompany from undergoing a corporate restructuring that would separate the Company\\u2019s talc liabilities from its\\nother assets. The Bankruptcy Court denied the motion. The Company thereafter \\ufb01led a motion to dismiss the\\nadversary proceeding. The Bankruptcy Court has not yet decided the motion to dismiss. In October 2021, the\\nCompany \\ufb01led a Notice of Bankruptcy Filing and Stay of Proceedings clarifying that the automatic stay arising upon\\nthe \\ufb01ling of the LTL Bankruptcy Case should apply to the Imerys Adversary Proceeding.\\nIn June 2020, Cyprus Mines Corporation and its parent, Cyprus Amax Minerals Company (CAMC) (together, Cyprus),\\nwhich had owned certain Imerys talc mines, \\ufb01led an adversary proceeding against the Company and Imerys in the\\nImerys Bankruptcy seeking a declaration of indemnity rights under certain contractual agreements (the Cyprus\\nAdversary Proceeding). The Company denies such indemni\\ufb01cation is owed, and \\ufb01led a motion to dismiss the\\nadversary complaint. In February 2021, Cyprus \\ufb01led a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 11 of the\\nBankruptcy Code and \\ufb01led its Disclosure Statement and Plan (the Cyprus Plan). The Cyprus Plan contemplates a\\nsettlement with Imerys and talc claimants where Cyprus would make a monetary contribution to a trust established\\nunder the Imerys Plan in exchange for an injunction against talc claims asserted against it and certain protected\\nparties. Cyprus has not yet sought approval of its Disclosure Statement and Plan. Cyprus, along with the TCC and\\nFCR appointed in the Cyprus chapter 11 case, have agreed to participate in the mediation with the Mediation\\nParties. In October 2021, the Company \\ufb01led a Notice of Bankruptcy Filing and Stay of Proceedings clarifying that the\\nautomatic stay arising upon the \\ufb01ling of the LTL Bankruptcy Case should apply to the Cyprus Adversary Proceeding.\\nIn June 2022, Cyprus commenced an Adversary Proceeding in its chapter 11 case seeking an order enforcing the\\nautomatic stay by enjoining parties from commencing or continuing \\u201ctalc-related claims\\u201d against CAMC. In June\\n2022, the court entered a preliminary injunction order enjoining claimants from pursuing talc-related claims against\\nCAMC through January 2023.\\nIn February 2021, several of the Company\\u2019s insurers involved in coverage litigation in New Jersey State Court (the\\nCoverage Action) \\ufb01led a motion in the Imerys Bankruptcy Court proceeding seeking a determination that the\\nautomatic stay does not apply to the Coverage Action and, in the alternative, seeking relief from the automatic stay\\nto allow them to continue to litigate their claims in the Coverage Action. In March 2021, the Company \\ufb01led a limited\\nresponse and reservation of rights with respect to the motion. The Court entered an agreed order modifying the\\nstay to allow the litigation in the Coverage Action to continue. In October 2021, LTL \\ufb01led a Notice of Bankruptcy\\nFiling and Stay of Proceedings clarifying that the automatic stay arising upon the \\ufb01ling of the LTL Bankruptcy Case\\nshould apply to the Coverage Action. In March 2022, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court ruled that the LTL automatic\\nstay applied to the Coverage Action.\\nIn February 2018, a securities class action lawsuit was \\ufb01led against the Company and certain named o\\ufb03cers in the\\nUnited States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that the Company violated the federal securities\\nlaws by failing to disclose alleged asbestos contamination in body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON\\u2019S\\nBaby Powder, and that purchasers of the Company\\u2019s shares su\\ufb00ered losses as a result. Plainti\\ufb00 is seeking damages.\\nIn April 2019, the Company moved to dismiss the complaint and brie\\ufb01ng on the motion was complete as of August\\n2019. In December 2019, the Court denied, in part, the motion to dismiss. In March 2020, the Company answered\\nthe complaint. In April 2021, brie\\ufb01ng on Plainti\\ufb00\\u2019s motion for class certi\\ufb01cation was completed. In July 2021, the\\nCompany \\ufb01led a notice of supplemental authority in opposition to Plainti\\ufb00\\u2019s motion for class certi\\ufb01cation, and\\nPlainti\\ufb00 \\ufb01led a response. In December 2021, the Company \\ufb01led a motion to supplement the class certi\\ufb01cation\\nrecord, and in January 2022, Plainti\\ufb00 responded. In March 2022, LTL asked the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court to stay\\nthe securities class action. In April 2022, Defendants \\ufb01led a second motion to supplement the class certi\\ufb01cation\\nrecord. In May 2022, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court entered an order staying the securities class action. Plainti\\ufb00\\nhas appealed the Bankruptcy Court\\u2019s order. 88 A lawsuit was brought against the Company in the Superior Court of California for the County of San Diego alleging\\nviolations of California\\u2019s Consumer Legal Remedies Act (CLRA) relating to JOHNSON\\u2019S Baby Powder. In that lawsuit,\\nthe plainti\\ufb00s allege that the Company violated the CLRA by failing to provide required Proposition 65 warnings. In\\nJuly 2019, the Company \\ufb01led a notice of removal to the United States District Court for the Southern District of\\nCalifornia and plainti\\ufb00s \\ufb01led a second amended complaint shortly thereafter. In October 2019, the Company moved\\nto dismiss the second amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. In response\\nto those motions, plainti\\ufb00s \\ufb01led a third amended complaint. In December 2019, the Company moved to dismiss the\\nthird amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. In April 2020, the Court\\ngranted the motion to dismiss but granted leave to amend. In May 2020, plainti\\ufb00s \\ufb01led a Fourth Amended\\nComplaint but indicated that they would be \\ufb01ling a motion for leave to \\ufb01le a \\ufb01fth amended complaint. Plainti\\ufb00s \\ufb01led\\na Fifth Amended Complaint in August 2020. The Company moved to dismiss the Fifth Amended Complaint for\\nfailure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. In January 2021, the Court issued an Order and opinion\\nruling in the Company\\u2019s favor and granting the motion to dismiss with prejudice. In February 2021, Plainti\\ufb00s \\ufb01led a\\nNotice of Appeal with the Ninth Circuit. Plainti\\ufb00s \\ufb01led their opening brief in July 2021. The company \\ufb01led its\\nresponsive brief in October 2021. In October 2021, Notice of Suggestion of Bankruptcy was \\ufb01led with the Ninth\\nCircuit. A bankruptcy stay was imposed in December 2021, and the Court held the reply deadline in abeyance. In\\nFebruary 2022, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order extending the stay. The appeal continues to be held in\\nabeyance, with the Company being required to \\ufb01le periodic status updates.\\nIn addition, the Company has received inquiries, subpoenas, and requests to produce documents regarding talc\\nmatters and the LTL Bankruptcy Case from various governmental authorities. The Company has produced\\ndocuments and responded to inquiries, and will continue to cooperate with government inquiries.\\nClaims for personal injury have been made against a number of Johnson & Johnson companies, including Janssen\\nPharmaceuticals, Inc. and the Company, arising out of the use of INVOKANA, a prescription medication indicated to\\nimprove glycemic control in adults with Type 2 diabetes. In December 2016, lawsuits \\ufb01led in federal courts in the\\nUnited States were organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the District of New\\nJersey. Cases have also been \\ufb01led in state courts. Class action lawsuits have been \\ufb01led in Canada. Product liability\\nlawsuits continue to be \\ufb01led, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and\\nthe anticipated number of cases. The Company has settled or otherwise resolved many of the cases and claims in\\nthe United States and the costs associated with these settlements are re\\ufb02ected in the Company\\u2019s accruals.\\nClaims for personal injury have been made against a number of Johnson & Johnson companies, including Janssen\\nPharmaceuticals, Inc. and the Company, arising out of the use of ELMIRON, a prescription medication indicated for\\nthe relief of bladder pain or discomfort associated with interstitial cystitis. These lawsuits, which allege that\\nELMIRONcontributes to the development of permanent retinal injury and vision loss, have been \\ufb01led in both state\\nand federal courts across the United States. In December 2020, lawsuits \\ufb01led in federal courts in the United States,\\nincluding putative class action cases seeking medical monitoring, were organized as a multi-district litigation in the\\nUnited States District Court for the District of New Jersey. In addition, cases have been \\ufb01led in various state courts\\nof New Jersey, which have been coordinated in a multi-county litigation in Bergen County, as well as the Court of\\nCommon Pleas in Philadelphia, which have been coordinated and granted mass tort designation. In addition, three\\nclass action lawsuits have been \\ufb01led in Canada. Product liability lawsuits continue to be \\ufb01led, and the Company\\ncontinues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. The Company\\nhas established accruals for defense and indemnity costs associated with ELMIRON related product liability\\nlitigation.\\nClaims for personal injury have been made against Johnson and Johnson Consumer Inc. (JJCI), arising out of the use\\nof TYLENOL, an over-the-counter pain medication, alleging that prenatal exposure to acetaminophen is associated\\nwith the development of autism spectrum disorder and/or attention-de\\ufb01cit/hyperactivity disorder. In October 2022,\\nlawsuits \\ufb01led in federal courts in the United States were organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States\\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of New York. In addition, lawsuits have been \\ufb01led in Canada. Product liability\\nlawsuits continue to be \\ufb01led, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and\\nthe anticipated number of cases. The Company has established accruals for defense costs associated with TYLENOL\\nrelated product liability litigation.\\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\\nCertain subsidiaries of the Company are subject, from time to time, to legal proceedings and claims related to\\npatent, trademark and other intellectual property matters arising out of their businesses. Many of these matters\\ninvolve challenges to the coverage and/or validity of the patents on various products and allegations that certain of\\nthe Company\\u2019s products infringe the patents of third parties. Although these subsidiaries believe that they have\\nsubstantial defenses to these challenges and allegations with respect to all signi\\ufb01cant patents, there can be no\\nassurance as to the outcome of these matters. A loss in any of these cases could adversely a\\ufb00ect the ability of\\nthese subsidiaries to sell their products, result in loss of sales due to loss of market exclusivity,  89 require the payment of past damages and future royalties, and may result in a non-cash impairment charge for any\\nassociated intangible asset. Signi\\ufb01cant matters are described below.\\nMedTech\\nIn August 2018, Intuitive Surgical, Inc. and Intuitive Surgical Operations, Inc. (collectively, Intuitive) \\ufb01led a patent\\ninfringement suit against Auris Health, Inc. (Auris) in United States District Court for the District of Delaware. In the\\nsuit, Intuitive alleges willful infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 6,522,906 (\\u2019906); 6,800,056 (\\u2019056); 8,142,447 (\\u2019447);\\nand 9,452,276 (\\u2019276) based on Auris\\u2019 MONARCH Platform. Auris \\ufb01led IPR Petitions with the U.S. Patent and\\nTrademark O\\ufb03ce (USPTO) regarding the \\u2019056, \\u2019447, \\u2019276 and \\u2019906 patents. In December 2019, the USPTO denied\\nreview of the \\u2019056 patent. In February and March 2020, the USPTO instituted review of the \\u2019447, and \\u2019906 patents\\nand denied review of the \\u2019276 patent. In March 2021, the USPTO ruled that the challenged claims of the \\u2019447 and\\n\\u2019906 patents are not invalid. Auris appealed, and in April 2022, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal\\nCircuit vacated the decision that the \\u2019447 patent was not invalid and remanded the decision to the USPTO for\\nfurther review. In May 2022, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit con\\ufb01rmed the ruling that\\nclaim 53 of the \\u2019906 patent was not invalid, vacated the decision that the remaining claims of the \\u2019906 patent were\\nnot invalid and remanded the decision to the USPTO for further review. Auris \\ufb01led a request for reexamination of\\nthe \\u2019276 patent in November 2021, and in January 2022, the USPTO granted the reexamination request. Trial is\\nscheduled to begin in September 2023.\\nIn August 2019, RSB Spine LLC (RSB Spine) \\ufb01led a patent infringement suit against DePuy Synthes, Inc. in the\\nUnited States District Court for the District of Delaware. In October 2019, RSB Spine amended the complaint to\\nchange the named defendants to DePuy Synthes Sales, Inc. and DePuy Synthes Products, Inc. In the suit, RSB Spine\\nalleges willful infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 6,984,234 (\\u2019234) and 9,713,537 (\\u2019537) by one or more of the\\nfollowing products: ZERO-P-VA Spacer, ZERO-P Spacer, ZERO-P NATURAL Plate, SYNFIX LR Spacer and SYNFIX\\nEvolution System. RSB Spine seeks monetary damages and injunctive relief. In November 2019, the suit was\\nconsolidated for pre-trial purposes with other patent infringement suits brought by RSB Spine in the United States\\nDistrict Court for the District of Delaware against Life Spine, Inc., Medacta USA, Inc., and Precision Spine, Inc. In\\nJune 2022, DePuy \\ufb01led potentially dispositive summary judgment motions that the \\u2019234 patent is invalid as\\nanticipated and the \\u2019537 patent is not infringed. In November 2022, the Court granted DePuy\\u2019s summary judgment\\nmotion that the \\u2019234 patent is invalid as anticipated and denied DePuy\\u2019s motion that the \\u2019537 patent is not\\ninfringed. In December 2022, the Court conducted a jury trial on the \\u2019537 patent where the jury found that the \\u2019537\\npatent was not literally infringed, but that DePuy infringed under the doctrine of equivalents (DOE). The jury\\nawarded RSB $12 million in damages subject to post-trial motions and appeals.\\nIn October 2020, Rasmussen Instruments, LLC (Rasmussen) \\ufb01led a patent infringement suit against DePuy Synthes\\nProducts, Inc., DePuy Synthes Sales, Inc. and Medical Device Business Services, Inc. (collectively, DePuy) in the\\nUnited States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. Rasmussen alleges that DePuy willfully infringes U.S.\\nPatent Nos. 9,492,180 (\\u2019180) and 10,517,583 (\\u2019583) by making and selling the Attune Balanced Sizer. In April 2021,\\nRasmussen sought permission to amend its infringement contentions to allege that DePuy also willfully infringes\\nthe \\u2019583 patent by making and selling the Attune Balancing Blocks. Rasmussen seeks treble damages for willful\\ninfringement. Trial concluded in March 2022, with the jury returning a verdict in favor of Rasmussen, \\ufb01nding willful\\ninfringement of the \\u2019180 patent, and awarding damages in the amount of $ 20 \\u00a0million. DePuy challenged the\\nverdict in its post-trial motions. In July 2022, a hearing was held on the post-trial motions.\\nPharmaceutical\\nLitigation Against Filers of Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs)\\nThe following summarizes lawsuits the Company\\u2019s subsidiaries have brought against generic companies that have\\n\\ufb01led ANDAs with the U.S. FDA or undertaken similar regulatory processes outside of the United States, seeking to\\nmarket generic forms of products sold by various subsidiaries of the Company prior to expiration of the applicable\\npatents covering those products. These ANDAs typically include allegations of non-infringement and invalidity of\\nthe applicable patents. The Inter Partes Review (IPR) process with the USPTO, created under the 2011 America\\nInvents Act, is also being used at times by generic companies in conjunction with ANDAs and lawsuits, to challenge\\nthe applicable patents.

In November 2021, Janssen also provided to Alkermes Pharma\\nIreland Limited three-months\\u2019 notice of termination of a License Agreement between Elan Pharma International\\nLimited and Janssen executed in July 2003. In April 2022, in response to these notices, Alkermes Pharma Ireland\\nLimited (Alkermes) initiated arbitration in the International Institute for Con\\ufb02ict Prevention and Resolution. The\\nparties exchanged opening briefs in July 2022 and responsive briefs in September 2022. In December 2022, the\\nArbitration Tribunal issued an Interim Decision \\ufb01nding that Janssen may terminate the agreements, but it may not\\ncontinue to sell products developed during the term of the agreements without continuing to pay royalties to\\nAlkermes.\\nGOVERNMENT PROCEEDINGS\\nLike other companies in the pharmaceutical, consumer health and medical devices industries, the Company and\\ncertain of its subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation by national, state and local government agencies in\\nthe United States and other countries in which they operate. Such regulation has been the basis of government\\ninvestigations and litigations. The most signi\\ufb01cant litigation brought by, and investigations conducted by,\\ngovernment agencies are listed below. It is possible that criminal charges and substantial \\ufb01nes and/or civil\\npenalties or damages could result from government investigations or litigation.\\nAverage Wholesale Price (AWP) Litigation\\nThe Company and several of its pharmaceutical subsidiaries (the J&J AWP Defendants), along with numerous other\\npharmaceutical companies, were named as defendants in a series of lawsuits in state and federal courts involving\\nallegations that the pricing and marketing of certain pharmaceutical products amounted to fraudulent and\\notherwise actionable conduct because, among other things, the companies allegedly reported an in\\ufb02ated Average\\nWholesale Price (AWP) for the drugs at issue. Payors alleged that they used those AWPs in calculating provider\\nreimbursement levels. The plainti\\ufb00s in these cases included three classes of private persons or entities that paid for\\nany portion of the purchase of the drugs at issue based on AWP, and state government entities that made Medicaid\\npayments for the drugs at issue based on AWP. Many of these cases, both federal actions and state actions\\nremoved to federal court, were consolidated for pre-trial purposes in a multi-district litigation in the United States\\nDistrict Court for the District of Massachusetts, where all claims against the J&J AWP Defendants were ultimately\\ndismissed. The J&J AWP Defendants also prevailed in a case brought by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Other\\nAWP cases have been resolved through court order or settlement. The case brought by Illinois was settled after\\ntrial. In New Jersey, a putative class action based upon AWP allegations is pending against Centocor, Inc. and Ortho\\nBiotech Inc. (both now Janssen Biotech, Inc.), the Company and ALZA Corporation. All other cases have been\\nresolved.\\nOpioid Litigation\\nBeginning in 2014 and continuing to the present, the Company and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI), along with\\nother pharmaceutical companies, have been named in close to 3,500 lawsuits related to the marketing of opioids,\\nincluding DURAGESIC, NUCYNTA and NUCYNTA ER. The suits also raise allegations related to previously owned\\nactive pharmaceutical ingredient supplier subsidiaries, Tasmanian Alkaloids Pty, Ltd. and Noramco, Inc. (both\\nsubsidiaries were divested in 2016). The majority of the cases have been \\ufb01led by state and local governments.\\nSimilar lawsuits have also been \\ufb01led by private plainti\\ufb00s and organizations, including but not limited to the\\nfollowing: individual plainti\\ufb00s on behalf of children born with Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome; hospitals; and health\\ninsurers/payors. To date, complaints against pharmaceutical manufacturers, including the Company and JPI, have\\nbeen \\ufb01led by the state Attorneys General in Arkansas, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi,\\nMissouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas,\\nWashington and West Virginia. Complaints against the manufacturers also have been \\ufb01led in state or federal court\\nby city, county and local government agencies in every state but Alaska. The Government of Puerto Rico \\ufb01led suit\\nin Superior Court of San Juan.  96 The Company, JPI and other pharmaceutical companies had also received subpoenas or requests for information\\nrelated to opioids marketing practices from the following state Attorneys General: Alaska, Indiana, Montana, New\\nHampshire, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Washington. In September 2017, the Company and JPI were\\ncontacted by the Texas and Colorado Attorney General\\u2019s O\\ufb03ces on behalf of approximately 38 states regarding a\\nmulti-state Attorney General investigation.\\nIn 2019, the trial in the matter \\ufb01led by the Oklahoma Attorney General resulted in a judgment against the Company\\nand JPI in the amount of $ 465 \\u00a0million. The Company and JPI appealed the judgment, and in November 2021, the\\nOklahoma Supreme Court reversed the trial court\\u2019s judgment and directed entry of judgment for Defendants. In\\nOctober 2019 the Company and JPI announced a settlement of the \\ufb01rst case set for trial in the MDL with two\\ncounties in Ohio. In April 2021, three California counties and the City of Oakland commenced a trial in California\\nstate court against the Company and JPI, and other a\\ufb03liates, as well as three other pharmaceutical manufacturers.\\nThe trial concluded in October 2021, and in December 2021, the Court entered a \\ufb01nal trial judgment in favor of\\nDefendants on all claims. In February 2022, Plainti\\ufb00s\\u2019 motion to set aside and vacate the judgment was denied.\\nPlainti\\ufb00s appealed the judgment, but later \\ufb01led a request to dismiss the appeal after electing to participate in the\\nnational settlement agreement.\\nIn October 2019, the Company announced a proposed agreement in principle that would include the Company\\npaying $ 4 \\u00a0billion as settlement of these matters that had not been tried or settled. In October 2020, the Company\\nagreed to contribute up to an additional $ 1 \\u00a0billion to an all-in settlement amount that would resolve opioid\\nlawsuits \\ufb01led and future claims by states, cities, counties and tribal governments, for a total of $ 5 \\u00a0billion which\\nhas been accrued, subject to various conditions and an agreement being \\ufb01nalized. This agreement is not an\\nadmission of liability or wrong-doing. In July 2021, the Company announced that the terms of the agreement to\\nsettle the state and subdivision claims had been \\ufb01nalized and approximately half of the all-in settlement was\\nexpected to be paid by the end of \\ufb01scal year 2022, depending upon the level of participation by the states and\\ntheir subdivisions. The terms provided a period of time for states to elect to participate in the agreement and,\\nthereafter, a period for the subdivisions of the participating states to opt-in. Based on expected participation, the\\nCompany committed in advance to proceed with the settlement in \\ufb01ve of the participating states (New York, Texas,\\nFlorida, Nevada, and New Mexico) and with tribal governments. By late February 2022, 45 states, \\ufb01ve territories,\\nthe District of Columbia, and the vast majority of eligible subdivisions had elected to participate in the settlement,\\nand the Company con\\ufb01rmed that the level of participation was su\\ufb03cient to proceed with the agreement as to all\\nparticipants. The agreement was e\\ufb00ective in April 2022. Also in April 2022, the Company entered into settlement\\nagreements with the states of Alabama and West Virginia and their participating subdivisions. In July 2022, the\\nCompany reached a settlement agreement with all litigating Oklahoma subdivisions, and in September 2022, the\\nCompany settled with the State of New Hampshire and its participating subdivisions. Consequently, by the end of\\nthe \\ufb01scal year 2022, the Company had settled the opioid claims advanced by all states except Washington.\\nThere are approximately 60 cases remaining post-settlement in various state courts. There are approximately 570\\nremaining federal cases against the Company and JPI coordinated in a federal Multi-District Litigation (MDL)\\npending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, and approximately 20 additional cases pending\\nagainst the Company and JPI in other federal courts. In addition, the Province of British Columbia \\ufb01led suit against\\nthe Company and its Canadian a\\ufb03liate Janssen Inc., and many other industry members, in Canada, and is seeking\\nto have that action certi\\ufb01ed as an opt in class action on behalf of other provincial/territorial and the federal\\ngovernments in Canada. Additional proposed class actions have been \\ufb01led in Canada against the Company and\\nJanssen Inc., and many other industry members, by and on behalf of people who used opioids (for personal\\ninjuries), municipalities and First Nations bands. In October 2019, an antitrust complaint was \\ufb01led by private\\nplainti\\ufb00s in federal court in Tennessee and is pending transfer to the MDL. These actions allege a variety of claims\\nrelated to opioid marketing practices, including false advertising, unfair competition, public nuisance, consumer\\nfraud violations, deceptive acts and practices, false claims and unjust enrichment. The suits generally seek\\npenalties and/or injunctive and monetary relief and, in some of the suits, the plainti\\ufb00s are seeking joint and several\\nliability among the defendants. An adverse judgment in any of these lawsuits could result in the imposition of large\\nmonetary penalties and signi\\ufb01cant damages including, punitive damages, cost of abatement, substantial \\ufb01nes,\\nequitable remedies and other sanctions.\\nIn August 2019, the Company received a grand jury subpoena from the United States Attorney\\u2019s O\\ufb03ce for the\\nEastern District of New York for documents related to the Company\\u2019s anti-diversion policies and procedures and\\ndistribution of its opioid medications, in what the Company understands to be part of a broader investigation into\\nmanufacturers\\u2019 and distributors\\u2019 monitoring programs and reporting under the Controlled Substances Act.\\nFrom June 2017 through December 2019, the Company\\u2019s Board of Directors received a series of shareholder\\ndemand letters alleging breaches of \\ufb01duciary duties related to the marketing of opioids. The Board retained\\nindependent counsel to investigate the allegations in the demands, and in April 2020, independent counsel\\ndelivered a report to the Board recommending that the 97 Company reject the shareholder demands and take the steps that are necessary or appropriate to secure dismissal\\nof related derivative litigation. The Board unanimously adopted the recommendations of the independent counsel\\u2019s\\nreport.\\nIn November 2019, one of the shareholders who sent a demand \\ufb01led a derivative complaint against the Company\\nas the nominal defendant and certain current and former directors and o\\ufb03cers as defendants in the Superior Court\\nof New Jersey. The complaint alleges breaches of \\ufb01duciary duties related to the marketing of opioids, and that the\\nCompany has su\\ufb00ered damages as a result of those alleged breaches. A series of additional derivative complaints\\nmaking similar allegations against the same and similar defendants were \\ufb01led in New Jersey state and federal\\ncourts in 2019 and 2020. By 2022, all but two state court cases had been voluntarily dismissed. In February 2022,\\nthe state court granted the Company\\u2019s motion to dismiss one of the two cases, and the shareholder that brought\\nthe second case \\ufb01led a notice of dismissal. The shareholder whose complaint was dismissed \\ufb01led a motion for\\nreconsideration. In May 2022, the state court held oral argument on the motion for reconsideration and\\nsubsequently denied the motion. The shareholder has appealed the state court\\u2019s dismissal order.\\nOther\\nIn August 2012, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc., DePuy, Inc. (now known as DePuy Synthes, Inc.), and Johnson & Johnson\\nServices, Inc. (collectively DePuy) received an informal request from the United States Attorney\\u2019s O\\ufb03ce for the\\nDistrict of Massachusetts and the Civil Division of the United States Department of Justice (the United States) for\\nthe production of materials relating to the DePuy ASR XL Hip device. In July 2014, the United States noti\\ufb01ed the\\nUnited States District Court for the District of Massachusetts that it had declined to intervene in a qui tam case \\ufb01led\\npursuant to the False Claims Act against the companies concerning the hip devices. In February 2016, the District\\nCourt granted the companies\\u2019 motion to dismiss with prejudice, unsealed the qui tam complaint, and denied the qui\\ntam relators\\u2019 request for leave to \\ufb01le a further amended complaint. The qui tam relators appealed the case to the\\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. In July 2017, the First Circuit a\\ufb03rmed the District Court\\u2019s\\ndismissal in part, reversed in part, and a\\ufb03rmed the decision to deny the relators\\u2019 request to \\ufb01le a third amended\\ncomplaint. In March 2021, DePuy \\ufb01led its motion to strike and dismiss the relators\\u2019 second amended complaint; the\\nDistrict Court denied DePuy\\u2019s motion to strike and dismiss in July 2021. DePuy \\ufb01led a motion for reconsideration of\\nthe District Court\\u2019s July 2021 ruling. In November 2021, the District Court granted DePuy\\u2019s motion for\\nreconsideration and dismissed the case with prejudice. The District Court\\u2019s order was unsealed in December 2021.\\nThe relators \\ufb01led several post-dismissal motions, including a January 2022 omnibus motion for reconsideration,\\nwhich the District Court denied. Following the District Court\\u2019s order dismissing the case with prejudice, DePuy \\ufb01led\\na December 2021 motion seeking the recovery of attorneys\\u2019 fees and costs, which the District Court denied except\\nas to costs. The Relators have appealed the District Court\\u2019s dismissal of the case to the First Circuit. The brie\\ufb01ng on\\nthe appeal is complete, the First Circuit held oral argument on December 6, 2022, and the First Circuit\\u2019s decision\\nremains pending.\\nIn October 2012, the Company was contacted by the California Attorney General\\u2019s o\\ufb03ce regarding a multi-state\\nAttorney General investigation of the marketing of surgical mesh products for hernia and urogynecological\\npurposes by the Company\\u2019s subsidiary, Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon). In May 2016, California and Washington \\ufb01led civil\\ncomplaints against the Company, Ethicon and Ethicon US, LLC alleging violations of their consumer protection\\nstatutes. Similar complaints were \\ufb01led against the companies by the following states: Kentucky, Mississippi, West\\nVirginia and Oregon. In April 2019, the Company and Ethicon settled the Washington case. In October 2019, the\\nCompany and Ethicon settled the multi-state investigation with 41 other states and the District of Columbia. In April\\n2020, the Company settled the West Virginia case. In October 2020, the Company settled with the Attorney General\\nof Oregon. In November 2020, the Company settled with the Attorney General of Mississippi. Trial in the Kentucky\\nmatter is scheduled for June 2023. The California case started trial in July 2019 and concluded in September 2019.\\nIn January 2020, the Court in California issued a statement of decision, \\ufb01nding in favor of the State of California,\\nand awarded civil penalties in the amount of $ 344 \\u00a0million. In April 2020, the Court in California denied the\\nCompany\\u2019s motion for a new trial. In August 2020, the Court entered judgment with respect to the penalties of $\\n344 \\u00a0million, but denied the Attorney General\\u2019s request for injunctive relief. The Company appealed the penalty\\njudgment. In April 2022, the Court of Appeals reduced the judgment to $ 302 \\u00a0million, but otherwise denied the\\nappeal. In July 2022, the Supreme Court of California denied the Company\\u2019s petition to review the Court of Appeals\\ndecision, and the Company recorded a charge to re\\ufb02ect the judgment in the second quarter of 2022. In November\\n2022, the Company petitioned the United States Supreme Court for review.\\nIn June 2014, the Mississippi Attorney General \\ufb01led a complaint in Chancery Court of The First Judicial District of\\nHinds County, Mississippi against the Company and Johnson & Johnson Consumer Companies, Inc. (now known as\\nJohnson & Johnson Consumer Inc.) (collectively, JJCI). The complaint alleges that JJCI violated the Mississippi\\nConsumer Protection Act by failing to disclose alleged health risks associated with female consumers\\u2019 use of talc\\ncontained in JOHNSON\\u2019S Baby Powder and JOHNSON\\u2019S Shower to Shower (a product divested in 2012) and seeks\\ninjunctive and monetary relief. The Company and JJCI moved for summary judgment on the grounds that the State\\u2019s\\nclaim was barred by preemption, which the trial court denied. The Mississippi Supreme Court granted the Company\\nand JJCI\\u2019s request to \\ufb01le an interlocutory appeal of the denial of the motion for summary judgment in late 2019.\\nBrie\\ufb01ng and oral argument were completed. Thereafter, the Court 98 rejected the interlocutory appeal in April 2021 and remanded the matter to the trial court. In August 2021, JJCI \\ufb01led\\na Petition for Writ of Certiorari in the United States Supreme Court as to the Mississippi Supreme Court\\u2019s ruling of\\nApril 2021. In December 2021 the United States Supreme Court denied the Petition for Writ of Certiorari. After the\\nMississippi Supreme Court remanded the matter to the trial court, the State moved for a trial setting. JJCI objected\\nto any trial setting as barred by the stay arising from the LTL Bankruptcy Case, referenced above, while the State\\nargued that the stay did not apply. In January 2022, the Court granted the State\\u2019s motion for trial setting and\\ndirected the parties to consult with the Court administrator to secure a trial date. In February 2022, the trial court\\nset the case for trial to begin in February 2023. However, given the e\\ufb00orts to resolve talc-related claims in the LTL\\nBankruptcy Case, the Company and the State agreed to a temporary stay of discovery until May 2022. The\\ntemporary stay expired in May 2022. LTL thereafter moved to enjoin prosecution of the case in the LTL Bankruptcy\\nCase. In October 2022, the bankruptcy court issued an order staying the case. The State \\ufb01led an appeal to the\\nThird Circuit concerning the stay order.\\nIn January 2020, the State of New Mexico \\ufb01led a consumer protection case alleging that the Company deceptively\\nmarketed and sold its talcum powder products by making misrepresentations about the safety of the products and\\nthe presence of carcinogens, including asbestos. The State of New Mexico \\ufb01led an Amended Complaint in March\\n2020. The Company moved to dismiss certain of the claims in the Amended Complaint, which was granted. The\\nCompany then \\ufb01led a motion for partial judgment on the pleadings in December 2020, which was denied. In March\\n2022, the New Mexico court denied the Company\\u2019s motion to compel the State of New Mexico to engage in\\ndiscovery of state agencies and denied the Company\\u2019s request for interlocutory appeal of that decision. The\\nCompany then \\ufb01led a Petition for Writ of Superintending Control and a Request for a Stay to the New Mexico\\nSupreme Court on the issue of the State of New Mexico\\u2019s discovery obligations. In April 2022, in view of the e\\ufb00orts\\nto resolve talc-related claims in the LTL Bankruptcy Case, the Company and the State agreed to a 60-day stay of all\\nmatters except for the pending writ before the New Mexico Supreme Court, which expired in June 2022. Thereafter,\\nthe Company moved to enjoin prosecution of the case in the LTL Bankruptcy Case. In October 2022, the bankruptcy\\ncourt issued an order staying the case. In December 2022, the State \\ufb01led an appeal to the Third Circuit concerning\\nthe stay order. Separately, in September 2022, the New Mexico Supreme Court granted the Company's request for\\na stay pending further brie\\ufb01ng on the scope of the State of New Mexico\\u2019s discovery obligations.\\nForty-two states and the District of Columbia have commenced a joint investigation into the Company\\u2019s marketing\\nof its talcum powder products. At this time, the multi-state group has not asserted any claims against the Company.\\nFive states have issued Civil Investigative Demands seeking documents and other information. The Company has\\nproduced documents to Arizona, North Carolina, Texas, and Washington and entered into con\\ufb01dentiality\\nagreements. The Company has not received any follow up requests from those states. In March 2022, each of the\\nforty-two states (including Mississippi and New Mexico) agreed to mediation of their claims in the LTL Bankruptcy\\nCase. In July 2022, New Mexico and Mississippi indicated they would no longer voluntarily submit to further\\nmediation in the LTL Bankruptcy and would proceed with their respective cases in state court. LTL moved the New\\nJersey Bankruptcy Court for an order staying further proceedings in those two actions, which the Bankruptcy Court\\ngranted in October 2022. In December 2022, the Bankruptcy Court allowed New Mexico and Mississippi to \\ufb01le a\\ndirect appeal of its stay.\\nIn July 2016, the Company and Janssen Products, LP were served with a qui tam complaint pursuant to the False\\nClaims Act \\ufb01led in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey alleging the o\\ufb00-label promotion of\\ntwo HIV products, PREZISTA and INTELENCE, and anti-kickback violations in connection with the promotion of these\\nproducts. The complaint was \\ufb01led under seal in December 2012. The federal and state governments have declined\\nto intervene, and the lawsuit is being prosecuted by the relators.

Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all\\nmaterial respects, e\\ufb00ective internal control over \\ufb01nancial reporting as of January 1, 2023, based on criteria\\nestablished in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\\nBasis for Opinions\\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated \\ufb01nancial statements, for maintaining e\\ufb00ective\\ninternal control over \\ufb01nancial reporting, and for its assessment of the e\\ufb00ectiveness of internal control over \\ufb01nancial\\nreporting, included in the accompanying Management\\u2019s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our\\nresponsibility is to express opinions on the Company\\u2019s consolidated \\ufb01nancial statements and on the Company's\\ninternal control over \\ufb01nancial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting \\ufb01rm registered with the\\nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with\\nrespect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations\\nof the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\\nperform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated \\ufb01nancial statements are free of\\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether e\\ufb00ective internal control over \\ufb01nancial\\nreporting was maintained in all material respects.\\nOur audits of the consolidated \\ufb01nancial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material\\nmisstatement of the consolidated \\ufb01nancial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures\\nthat respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts\\nand disclosures in the consolidated \\ufb01nancial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting\\nprinciples used and signi\\ufb01cant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of\\nthe consolidated \\ufb01nancial statements. Our audit of internal control over \\ufb01nancial reporting included obtaining an\\nunderstanding of internal control over \\ufb01nancial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and\\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating e\\ufb00ectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our\\naudits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We\\nbelieve that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\\nAs described in Management\\u2019s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management has excluded\\nAbiomed, Inc., (\\u201cAbiomed\\u201d) from its assessment of internal control over \\ufb01nancial reporting as of January 1, 2023,\\nbecause it was acquired by the Company in a business combination during 2022. We have also excluded Abiomed\\nfrom our audit of internal control over \\ufb01nancial reporting. Abiomed is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets\\nand total sales excluded from management\\u2019s assessment and our audit of internal control over \\ufb01nancial reporting\\nrepresent less than 1% of each of the related consolidated \\ufb01nancial statement amounts as of and for the \\ufb01scal year\\nended January 1, 2023.\\nDe\\ufb01nition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nA company\\u2019s internal control over \\ufb01nancial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\\nregarding the reliability of \\ufb01nancial reporting and the preparation of \\ufb01nancial statements for external purposes in\\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\\u2019s internal control over \\ufb01nancial reporting\\nincludes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\\naccurately and fairly re\\ufb02ect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable\\nassurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of \\ufb01nancial statements in accordance\\nwith generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made\\nonly in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable\\nassurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the\\ncompany\\u2019s assets that could have a material e\\ufb00ect on the \\ufb01nancial statements. 103 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over \\ufb01nancial reporting may not prevent or detect\\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of e\\ufb00ectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the\\npolicies or procedures may deteriorate.\\nCritical Audit Matters\\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the\\nconsolidated \\ufb01nancial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee\\nand that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated \\ufb01nancial statements and (ii)\\ninvolved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters\\ndoes not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated \\ufb01nancial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not,\\nby communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on\\nthe accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\\nU.S. Pharmaceutical Rebate Reserves \\u2013 Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid\\nAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated \\ufb01nancial statements, the Company recognizes revenue from product\\nsales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satis\\ufb01ed. Rebates and discounts\\nprovided to customers are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales. The liability\\nfor such rebates and discounts is recognized within Accrued Rebates, Returns, and Promotions on the consolidated\\nbalance sheet. A signi\\ufb01cant portion of the liability related to rebates is from the sale of pharmaceutical goods within\\nthe U.S., primarily the Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid programs, which amounted to $9.6 billion as of\\nJanuary 1, 2023. For signi\\ufb01cant rebate programs, which include the U.S. Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid\\nrebate programs, rebates and discounts estimated by management are based on contractual terms, historical\\nexperience, patient outcomes, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the U.S. pharmaceutical market.\\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to U.S. pharmaceutical\\nrebate reserves - Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid is a critical audit matter are the signi\\ufb01cant judgment by\\nmanagement due to the signi\\ufb01cant measurement uncertainty involved in developing these reserves and the high\\ndegree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and audit e\\ufb00ort in performing procedures and evaluating the assumptions\\nrelated to contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis, and projected market\\nconditions in the U.S. pharmaceutical market.\\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming\\nour overall opinion on the consolidated \\ufb01nancial statements. These procedures included testing the e\\ufb00ectiveness of\\ncontrols relating to U.S. pharmaceutical rebate reserves - Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid, including controls\\nover the assumptions used to estimate these rebates. These procedures also included, among others, (i)\\ndeveloping an independent estimate of the rebates by utilizing third party information on price and market\\nconditions in the U.S. pharmaceutical market, the terms of the speci\\ufb01c rebate programs, and the historical\\nexperience and trend analysis of actual rebate claims paid; (ii) testing rebate claims processed by the Company,\\nincluding evaluating those claims for consistency with the contractual and mandated terms of the Company\\u2019s\\nrebate arrangements; and (iii) comparing the independent estimates to management\\u2019s estimates.\\nLitigation Contingencies \\u2013 Talc\\nAs described in Notes 1 and 19 to the consolidated \\ufb01nancial statements, the Company records accruals for loss\\ncontingencies associated with legal matters, including talc, when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and\\nthe amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse awards, judgments, or verdicts have\\nbeen rendered against the Company, management does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be\\nprobable and can be reasonably estimated. For these matters, management is unable to estimate the possible loss\\nor range of loss beyond the amounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex\\nseries of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including\\ntiming of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be a\\ufb00ected by various factors,\\nincluding, among other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate;\\nscienti\\ufb01c and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters\\npresent legal uncertainties; there are signi\\ufb01cant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty\\nand unpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements;\\ncomplexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. Management\\ncontinues to believe that the Company has strong legal grounds to contest the talc verdicts it has appealed.\\nNotwithstanding management\\u2019s con\\ufb01dence in the safety of the Company\\u2019s talc products, in certain circumstances\\nthe Company has settled cases. In October 2021, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. (Old JJCI), a wholly-owned\\nsubsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, implemented a corporate restructuring and created a subsidiary, LTL Management\\nLLC (LTL), which became solely responsible for the talc-related liabilities, and another subsidiary, New JJCI, which\\nbecame responsible for the remaining business of Old JJCI. LTL \\ufb01led a voluntary petition, seeking relief under\\nchapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. As a result of the LTL bankruptcy case, the Court entered a temporary\\nrestraining order staying all litigation against LTL and Old JJCI. On November 15, 2021, the North Carolina\\nBankruptcy Court con\\ufb01rmed the scope of the stay, issuing a Preliminary Injunction (PI) prohibiting and enjoining the\\ncommencement and prosecution of talc-related claims against LTL, Old JJCI, New JJCI, Johnson & Johnson, other of\\ntheir corporate a\\ufb03liates, identi\\ufb01ed retailers, insurance companies, and certain other parties. The LTL Bankruptcy\\nCase was transferred to the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey in November 2021, and\\nthat court extended the PI through the end of 104 February 2022. Claimants \\ufb01led motions to dismiss the LTL Bankruptcy Case and, following a multiple day hearing,\\nthe New Jersey Bankruptcy Court denied those motions by order issued in March 2022. The New Jersey Bankruptcy\\nCourt simultaneously issued another order extending the stay as to the Protected Parties. The claimants\\nsubsequently \\ufb01led notices of appeal as to the denial of the motions to dismiss and the extension of the stay. In May\\n2022,the Third Circuit Court of Appeals granted the petitions to appeal. The brie\\ufb01ng and oral argument on the\\nappeal were completed in September 2022. On January 30, 2023, the Third Circuit reversed the Bankruptcy Court\\u2019s\\nruling and remanded to the Bankruptcy Court to dismiss the LTL bankruptcy. LTL has \\ufb01led a petition for rehearing on\\nthe decision.\\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the talc litigation is a\\ncritical audit matter are the signi\\ufb01cant judgment by management when assessing the likelihood of a loss being\\nincurred and when determining whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss for the future and\\nexisting talc claims can be made, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and e\\ufb00ort in\\nperforming procedures and evaluating management\\u2019s assessment of the loss contingencies associated with this\\nlitigation.\\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming\\nour overall opinion on the consolidated \\ufb01nancial statements. These procedures included testing the e\\ufb00ectiveness of\\ncontrols relating to management\\u2019s evaluation of the talc litigation, including controls over determining whether a\\nloss is probable and whether the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, as well as \\ufb01nancial statement\\ndisclosures. These procedures also included, among others, (i) gaining an understanding of the Company\\u2019s process\\naround the accounting and reporting for the talc litigation; (ii) discussing the status of signi\\ufb01cant known actual and\\npotential litigation and the ongoing LTL bankruptcy proceedings with the Company\\u2019s in-house legal counsel, as well\\nas external counsel when deemed necessary; (iii) obtaining and evaluating the letters of audit inquiry with internal\\nand external legal counsel for signi\\ufb01cant litigation; (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of management\\u2019s\\nassessment regarding whether an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible or probable and reasonably\\nestimable; and (v) evaluating the su\\ufb03ciency of the Company\\u2019s litigation contingencies disclosures.\\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\\nFlorham Park, New Jersey\\nFebruary 16, 2023\\nWe have served as the Company\\u2019s auditor since at least 1920.

Business Description \\nBerkshire Hathaway Inc. (\\u201cBerkshire,\\u201d \\u201cCompany\\u201d or \\u201cRegistrant\\u201d) is a holding company owning subsidiaries \\nengaged in numerous diverse business activities. The most important of these are insurance businesses conducted \\non both a primary basis and a reinsurance basis, a freight rail transportation business and a group of utility and \\nenergy generation and distribution businesses. Berkshire also owns and operates numerous other businesses \\nengaged in a variety of manufacturing, services, retailing and other activities. Berkshire is domiciled in the state of \\nDelaware, and its corporate headquarters is in Omaha, Nebraska.\\nBerkshire\\u2019s operating businesses are managed on an unusually decentralized basis. There are few centralized \\nor integrated business functions. Berkshire\\u2019s corporate senior management team participates in and is ultimately \\nresponsible for signi\\ufb01cant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive \\nto head each of the operating businesses. \\nBerkshire\\u2019s senior management is also responsible for establishing and monitoring Berkshire\\u2019s corporate \\ngovernance practices, including monitoring governance e\\ufb00orts, including those at the operating businesses, and \\nparticipating in the resolution of governance-related issues as needed. Berkshire\\u2019s Board of Directors is responsible \\nfor assuring an appropriate successor to the Chief Executive O\\ufb03cer. The Berkshire Code of Business Conduct and \\nEthics emphasizes, among other things, the commitment to ethics and compliance with government laws and \\nregulations and provides basic standards for ethical and legal behavior of its employees. \\nHuman capital and resources are an integral and essential component of Berkshire\\u2019s businesses. Berkshire \\nand its consolidated subsidiaries employed approximately 383,000 people worldwide at the end of 2022, of which \\napproximately 78% were in the United States (\\u201cU.S.\\u201d) and 20% were represented by unions. Employees engage in a \\nwide variety of occupations. Consistent with Berkshire\\u2019s decentralized management philosophy, Berkshire\\u2019s \\noperating businesses individually establish speci\\ufb01c policies and practices concerning the attraction and retention of \\npersonnel within their organizations. Given the wide variations in the nature and size of business activities, speci\\ufb01c \\npolicies and practices may vary widely among Berkshire\\u2019s operating subsidiaries. Policies and practices commonly \\naddress, among other things: maintaining a safe work environment and minimizing or eliminating workplace \\ninjuries; o\\ufb00ering competitive compensation, which includes various health insurance and retirement bene\\ufb01ts, as \\nwell as incentives to recognize and reward performance; wellness programs; training, learning and career \\nadvancement opportunities; and hiring practices intended to identify quali\\ufb01ed candidates and promote diversity \\nand inclusion in the workforce. Berkshire\\u2019s consolidated U.S. workforce demographics, based on U.S. Equal \\nEmployment Opportunity Commission guidelines, are available on its website \\n(https://www.berkshirehathaway.com), under sustainability.\\nInsurance and Reinsurance Businesses \\nBerkshire\\u2019s insurance and reinsurance business activities are conducted through numerous domestic and \\nforeign-based insurance subsidiaries. Berkshire\\u2019s insurance subsidiaries provide insurance and reinsurance of \\nproperty and casualty risks and reinsurance of life and health risks worldwide. Berkshire\\u2019s insurance subsidiaries \\nemployed approximately 50,000 people at the end of 2022. For purposes of this discussion, entities that provide \\ninsurance or reinsurance are referred to as insurers. \\nIn direct or primary insurance activities, the insurer assumes the risk of loss from persons or organizations \\nthat are directly subject to the risks. Such risks may relate to property, casualty (or liability), life, accident, health, \\n\\ufb01nancial or other perils that may arise from an insurable event. In reinsurance activities, the insurer assumes \\nde\\ufb01ned portions of risks that other direct insurers or reinsurers assumed in their own insuring activities. \\nReinsurance contracts are normally classi\\ufb01ed as treaty or facultative contracts. Treaty reinsurance refers to \\nreinsurance coverage for all or a portion of a speci\\ufb01ed group or class of risks ceded by a direct insurer or reinsurer, \\nwhile facultative reinsurance involves coverage of speci\\ufb01c individual underlying risks. Reinsurance contracts are \\nfurther classi\\ufb01ed as quota-share or excess. Under quota-share (proportional or pro-rata) reinsurance, the reinsurer \\nshares proportionally in the original premiums and losses of the direct insurer or reinsurer. Excess (or non-\\nproportional) reinsurance provides for the indemni\\ufb01cation of the direct insurer or reinsurer for all or a portion of the \\nloss in excess of an agreed upon amount or \\u201cretention.\\u201d Both quota-share and excess reinsurance contracts may \\nprovide for aggregate limits of indemni\\ufb01cation. \\nInsurance and reinsurance are generally subject to regulatory oversight throughout the world. Except for \\nregulatory considerations, there are virtually no barriers to entry into the insurance and reinsurance industry. \\nCompetitors may be domestic or foreign, as well as licensed or unlicensed. The number of competitors within the \\nindustry is not known. Insurers compete on the basis of reliability, \\ufb01nancial strength and stability, \\ufb01nancial ratings, \\nunderwriting consistency, service, business ethics, price, performance, capacity, policy terms and coverage \\nconditions. \\nK-1 \\u00a0\\nInsurers based in the U.S. are subject to regulation by their states of domicile and by those states in which \\nthey are licensed to write policies on an admitted basis. The primary focus of regulation is to assure that insurers \\nare \\ufb01nancially solvent and that policyholder interests are otherwise protected. States establish minimum capital \\nlevels for insurance companies and establish guidelines for permissible business and investment activities. States \\nhave the authority to suspend or revoke a company\\u2019s authority to do business as conditions warrant. States \\nregulate the payment of dividends by insurance companies to their shareholders and other transactions with \\na\\ufb03liates. Dividends, capital distributions and other transactions of extraordinary amounts are subject to prior \\nregulatory approval. \\nInsurers may market, sell and service insurance policies in the states where they are licensed. These insurers \\nare referred to as admitted insurers. Admitted insurers are generally required to obtain regulatory approval of their \\npolicy forms and premium rates. Non-admitted insurance markets have developed to provide insurance that is \\notherwise unavailable through admitted insurers. Non-admitted insurance, often referred to as \\u201cexcess and surplus\\u201d \\nlines, is procured by either state-licensed surplus lines brokers who place risks with insurers not licensed in that \\nstate or by the insured party\\u2019s direct procurement from non-admitted insurers. Non-admitted insurance is subject to \\nconsiderably less regulation with respect to policy rates and forms. Reinsurers are normally not required to obtain \\nregulatory approval of premium rates or reinsurance contracts. \\nThe insurance regulators of every state participate in the National Association of Insurance Commissioners \\n(\\u201cNAIC\\u201d). The NAIC adopts forms, instructions and accounting procedures for use by U.S. insurers in preparing and \\n\\ufb01ling annual statutory \\ufb01nancial statements. However, an insurer\\u2019s state of domicile has ultimate authority over \\nthese matters. In addition to its activities relating to the annual statement, the NAIC develops or adopts statutory \\naccounting principles, model laws, regulations and programs for use by its members. Such matters deal with \\nregulatory oversight of solvency, risk management, compliance with \\ufb01nancial regulation standards and risk-based \\ncapital reporting requirements. \\nU.S. states, through the NAIC, and international insurance regulators through the International Association of \\nInsurance Supervisors (\\u201cIAIS\\u201d) have been developing standards and best practices focused on establishing a \\ncommon set of principles (\\u201cInsurance Core Principles\\u201d) and framework (\\u201cComFrame\\u201d) for the regulation of large \\nmulti-national insurance groups. The IAIS is developing capital standards for internationally active insurance groups \\n(the \\u201cInsurance Capital Standard\\u201d) based on a consolidated group approach and is also evaluating a potentially \\ncomparable group capital standard based on the aggregation of regulated entities and their underlying local capital \\nrequirements (the \\u201cAggregation Method\\u201d). The IAIS standards address a variety of topics regarding supervision, \\ncoordination of regulators, insurance capital standards, risk management and governance. While the IAIS standards \\ndo not have legal e\\ufb00ect, U.S. state insurance departments and the NAIC are implementing various group \\nsupervision regulatory tools and mandates that are responsive to certain IAIS standards. U.S. state regulators have \\nformed supervisory colleges intended to promote communication and cooperation amongst the various domestic \\nand international insurance regulators. The Nebraska Department of Insurance acts as the lead supervisor for our \\ngroup of insurance companies and chairs the Berkshire supervisory college. U.S. state regulators require insurance \\ngroups to \\ufb01le an annual report and an Own Risk Solvency Assessment or ORSA, with the group\\u2019s lead supervisor. \\nThe NAIC recently adopted a group capital calculation based on methodology similar to the Aggregation Method, \\nwhich leverages the NAIC\\u2019s existing Risk Based Capital standards. The NAIC\\u2019s group capital calculation is a tool \\ndesigned to help the lead supervisor understand the capital adequacy across an insurance group. The NAIC is also \\ndeveloping further tools, including various liquidity assessments, that will likely be imposed on insurance groups in \\nthe future. \\nBerkshire\\u2019s insurance companies maintain capital strength at exceptionally high levels, which di\\ufb00erentiates \\nthem from their competitors. The combined statutory surplus of Berkshire\\u2019s U.S.-based insurers was approximately \\n$272 billion at December 31, 2022. Berkshire\\u2019s major insurance subsidiaries are rated AA+ by Standard & Poor\\u2019s \\nand A++ (superior) by A.M. Best with respect to their \\ufb01nancial condition and claims paying ability. \\nThe Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 established within the Department of the Treasury a Terrorism \\nInsurance Program (\\u201cProgram\\u201d) for commercial property and casualty insurers by providing federal reinsurance of \\ninsured terrorism losses. The Program currently extends to December 31, 2027 through other Acts, most recently \\nthe Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2019. Hereinafter these Acts are collectively referred \\nto as TRIA. Under TRIA, the Department of the Treasury is charged with certifying \\u201cacts of terrorism.\\u201d Coverage \\nunder TRIA occurs if the industry insured loss for certi\\ufb01ed events occurring during the calendar year exceeds $200 \\nmillion in any calendar year. \\nTo be eligible for federal reinsurance, insurers must make available insurance coverage for acts of terrorism, \\nby providing policyholders with clear and conspicuous notice of the amount of premium that will be charged for this \\ncoverage and of the federal share of any insured losses resulting from any act of terrorism. Assumed reinsurance is \\nspeci\\ufb01cally excluded from TRIA participation. TRIA currently also excludes certain forms of direct insurance (such as \\npersonal and commercial auto, burglary, theft, surety and certain professional liability lines). Reinsurers are not \\nrequired to o\\ufb00er terrorism coverage and are not eligible for federal reinsurance of terrorism losses. \\nK-2 \\u00a0\\nIn the event of a certi\\ufb01ed act of terrorism, the federal government will reimburse insurers (conditioned on \\ntheir satisfaction of policyholder noti\\ufb01cation requirements) for 80% of their insured losses in excess of an insurance \\ngroup\\u2019s deductible. Under the Program, the deductible is 20% of the aggregate direct subject earned premium for \\nrelevant commercial lines of business in the immediately preceding calendar year. The aggregate deductible in \\n2023 for Berkshire\\u2019s insurance group is expected to approximate $2.25 billion. There is also an aggregate program \\nlimit of $100 billion on the amount of the federal government coverage for each TRIA year. \\nThe extent of insurance regulation varies signi\\ufb01cantly among the countries in which our non-U.S. operations \\nconduct business. While each country imposes licensing, solvency, auditing and \\ufb01nancial reporting requirements, \\nthe type and extent of the requirements di\\ufb00er substantially. For example:\\n\\u2022in some countries, insurers are required to prepare and \\ufb01le monthly and/or quarterly \\ufb01nancial \\nreports, and in others, only annual reports;\\n\\u2022some regulators require intermediaries to be involved in the sale of insurance products, whereas \\nother regulators permit direct sales contact between the insurer and the customer;\\n\\u2022the extent of restrictions imposed upon an insurer\\u2019s use of local and o\\ufb00shore reinsurance vary;\\n\\u2022policy form \\ufb01ling and rate regulation vary by country;\\n\\u2022the frequency of contact and periodic on-site examinations by insurance authorities di\\ufb00er by \\ncountry; \\n\\u2022the scope and prescriptive requirements of an insurer\\u2019s risk management and governance \\nframework vary signi\\ufb01cantly by country; and\\n\\u2022regulatory requirements relating to insurer dividend policies vary by country.\\nSigni\\ufb01cant variations can also be found in the size, structure and resources of the local regulatory \\ndepartments that oversee insurance activities. Certain regulators prefer close relationships with all subject insurers \\nand others operate a risk-based approach.\\nBerkshire\\u2019s insurance group operates in some countries through subsidiaries and in some countries through \\nbranches of subsidiaries. Berkshire insurance subsidiaries are located in several countries, including Germany, the \\nUnited Kingdom (\\u201cU.K.\\u201d), Ireland, Australia and South Africa, and also maintain branches in several other countries. \\nMost of these foreign jurisdictions impose local capital requirements. Other legal requirements include discretionary \\nlicensing procedures, local retention of funds and records, and data privacy and protection program requirements. \\nBerkshire\\u2019s international insurance companies are also subject to multinational application of certain U.S. laws.\\nThere are various regulatory bodies and initiatives that impact Berkshire in multiple international jurisdictions \\nand the potential for signi\\ufb01cant e\\ufb00ect on the Berkshire insurance group could be heightened as a result of recent \\nindustry and economic developments. In 2016, the U.K. voted in a national referendum to withdraw from the \\nEuropean Union (\\u201cEU\\u201d) (\\u201cBrexit\\u201d), which resulted in the U.K.\\u2019s withdrawal from the EU on January 31, 2020. In \\nanticipation of the U.K. leaving the EU, Berkshire Hathaway European Insurance DAC in Ireland was established to \\npermit property and casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses to continue to operate in the EU. Berkshire also \\ncontinues to maintain a substantial presence in London following Brexit.\\nAlleghany Corporation (\\u201cAlleghany\\u201d), based in New York, New York, was acquired by Berkshire on October 19, \\n2022. Alleghany\\u2019s operating subsidiaries include property and casualty reinsurance and insurance, as well as a \\nportfolio of non-\\ufb01nancial businesses. Information regarding Alleghany\\u2019s primary insurance and reinsurance \\nactivities is provided in the Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group sections \\nand its non-insurance businesses are included in the manufacturing and services sections. \\nBerkshire\\u2019s insurance underwriting operations include the following groups: (1) GEICO, (2) Berkshire Hathaway \\nPrimary Group and (3) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group. Except for retroactive reinsurance and periodic \\npayment annuity products, which generate signi\\ufb01cant amounts of up-front premiums along with estimated claims \\nexpected to be paid over long time periods (creating \\u201c\\ufb02oat,\\u201d see Investments section), Berkshire expects to achieve \\nan underwriting pro\\ufb01t over time and that its managers will reject inadequately priced risks. Underwriting pro\\ufb01t is \\nde\\ufb01ned as earned premiums less associated incurred losses, loss adjustment expenses and underwriting and policy \\nacquisition expenses. Underwriting pro\\ufb01t does not include income earned from investments. Additional information \\nrelated to each of Berkshire\\u2019s underwriting groups follows. \\nK-3 \\u00a0\\nGEICO\\u2014GEICO is headquartered in Chevy Chase, Maryland. GEICO\\u2019s insurance subsidiaries consist of \\nGovernment Employees Insurance Company, GEICO General Insurance Company, GEICO Indemnity Company, \\nGEICO Casualty Company, GEICO Advantage Insurance Company, GEICO Choice Insurance Company, GEICO Secure \\nInsurance Company, GEICO County Mutual Insurance Company, GEICO Texas County Mutual Insurance Company \\nand GEICO Marine Insurance Company. The GEICO companies primarily o\\ufb00er private passenger automobile \\ninsurance to individuals in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. GEICO also provides insurance for motorcycles, \\nall-terrain vehicles, recreational vehicles, boats and small commercial \\ufb02eets and acts as an agent for other insurers \\nwho o\\ufb00er homeowners, renters, life and identity management insurance to individuals desiring insurance \\ncoverages other than those o\\ufb00ered by GEICO.\\nGEICO\\u2019s marketing is primarily through direct response methods in which applications for insurance are \\nsubmitted directly to the companies via the Internet or by telephone, and to a lesser extent, through captive \\nagents. GEICO conducts business through regional service centers and claims adjustment and other facilities in 39 \\nstates. \\nThe automobile insurance business is highly competitive in the areas of price and service. GEICO competes for \\nprivate passenger automobile insurance customers in the preferred, standard and non-standard risk markets with \\nother companies that sell directly to the customer and with companies that use agency sales forces, including State \\nFarm, Allstate, Progressive and USAA. GEICO\\u2019s advertising campaigns and competitive rates contributed to a \\ncumulative increase in voluntary policies-in-force of approximately 4.0% over the past \\ufb01ve years. During 2022, \\nGEICO experienced a reduction of 1.7 million voluntary policies-in-force after \\ufb02at year-over-year growth from 2020 \\nto 2021. According to the most recently published A.M. Best data for 2021, the \\ufb01ve largest automobile insurers had \\na combined market share in 2021 of approximately 60.5% based on written premiums, with GEICO\\u2019s market share \\nbeing the second largest at approximately 14.4%. GEICO\\u2019s management estimates its current market share is \\napproximately 13.9%. The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent supply chain disruptions a\\ufb00ecting automobile \\nmanufacturers have impacted GEICO\\u2019s business and underwriting results in 2020 and thereafter. Seasonal \\nvariations in GEICO\\u2019s insurance business are not signi\\ufb01cant. However, extraordinary weather conditions or other \\nfactors may have a signi\\ufb01cant e\\ufb00ect upon the frequency or severity of automobile claims.\\nState insurance departments stringently regulate private passenger auto insurance. As a result, it is di\\ufb03cult \\nfor insurance companies to di\\ufb00erentiate their products. Competition for private passenger automobile insurance \\ntends to focus on price and level of customer service provided. GEICO\\u2019s cost-e\\ufb03cient direct response marketing \\nmethods and emphasis on customer satisfaction enable it to o\\ufb00er competitive rates and value to its customers. \\nGEICO primarily uses its own claims sta\\ufb00 to manage and settle claims. The name and reputation of GEICO are \\nmaterial assets and management protects those and other service marks through appropriate registrations.\\nBerkshire Hathaway Primary Group\\u2014The Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (\\u201cBH Primary\\u201d) is a collection \\nof independently managed insurers that provide a wide variety of insurance coverages to policyholders located \\nprincipally in the U.S. These various operations are discussed below. \\nNational Indemnity Company (\\u201cNICO\\u201d), domiciled in Nebraska, and certain a\\ufb03liates (\\u201cNICO Primary\\u201d) \\nunderwrite commercial motor vehicle and general liability insurance on an admitted basis and on an excess and \\nsurplus basis.

BH Specialty writes business through \\nwholesale and retail insurance brokers, as well as managing general agents. \\nAlleghany\\u2019s property and casualty insurance business is conducted in the U.S. on both an admitted and non-\\nadmitted basis through RSUI Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (\\u201cRSUI\\u201d) and CapSpecialty, Inc. and its subsidiaries \\n(\\u201cCapSpecialty\\u201d). RSUI and CapSpecialty primarily write specialty insurance in the property, umbrella/excess \\nliability, professional liability, directors\\u2019 and o\\ufb03cers\\u2019 liability, and general liability lines of business. Insurance is \\nwritten through independent wholesale insurance brokers, retail agents and managing general agents.\\nK-4 \\u00a0\\nMedPro Group (\\u201cMedPro\\u201d) is a leading provider of healthcare liability (\\u201cHCL\\u201d) insurance based on premiums \\nwritten.

MLMIC distributes the majority of its policies on a direct basis to medical and dental professionals, health \\ncare providers and hospitals.\\nBerkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group\\u2014Berkshire\\u2019s combined global reinsurance business, referred to \\nas the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (\\u201cBHRG\\u201d), o\\ufb00ers a wide range of coverages on property, casualty, \\nlife and health risks to insurers and reinsurers worldwide. BHRG conducts business activities in 27 countries. \\nReinsurance business is written through NICO and several other Berkshire insurance subsidiaries (\\u201cNICO Group\\u201d), \\nGeneral Re Corporation, and its subsidiaries (\\u201cGeneral Re Group\\u201d) and Alleghany\\u2019s Transatlantic Reinsurance \\nCompany and a\\ufb03liates (\\u201cTransRe Group\\u201d). The NICO Group and Gen Re Group underwriting operations in the U.S. \\nare based in Stamford, Connecticut and the TransRe Group is based in New York, New York.\\nThe type and volume of business written is dependent on market conditions, including prevailing premium \\nrates and coverage terms. The level of underwriting activities often \\ufb02uctuates signi\\ufb01cantly from year to year \\ndepending on the perceived level of price adequacy in speci\\ufb01c insurance and reinsurance markets as well as from \\nthe timing of particularly large reinsurance transactions.\\nProperty/casualty \\nThe NICO Group o\\ufb00ers traditional property/casualty reinsurance on both an excess-of-loss and a quota-share \\nbasis, catastrophe excess-of-loss treaty and facultative reinsurance, and primary insurance on an excess-of-loss \\nbasis for large or unusual risks. The type and volume of business written by the NICO Group may vary signi\\ufb01cantly \\nfrom period to period resulting from changes in perceived premium rate adequacy and from unique or large \\ntransactions. A signi\\ufb01cant portion of NICO Group\\u2019s annual reinsurance premium volume currently derives from a \\n20% quota-share agreement with Insurance Australia Group Limited (\\u201cIAG\\u201d) that incepted in 2015. The agreement \\nwas renewed, and extended, e\\ufb00ective January 1, 2023, with an expiration of December 31, 2029. IAG is a multi-line \\ninsurer in Australia, New Zealand and other Asia-Paci\\ufb01c countries.\\nThe General Re Group conducts a global property and casualty reinsurance business. Reinsurance contracts \\nare written on both a quota-share and excess basis for multiple lines of business. Contracts are primarily in the \\nform of treaties, and to a lesser degree, on a facultative basis. General Re Group conducts business in North \\nAmerica, primarily marketed on a direct basis through General Reinsurance Corporation (\\u201cGRC\\u201d), which is licensed \\nin the District of Columbia and all states, except Hawaii, where it is an accredited reinsurer. GRC also conducts \\noperations in North America through 11 branch o\\ufb03ces in the U.S. and Canada.\\nIn North America, the General Re Group includes General Star National Insurance Company, General Star \\nIndemnity Company and Genesis Insurance Company, which o\\ufb00er a broad array of specialty and surplus lines and \\nproperty, casualty and professional liability coverages. Such business is marketed through a select group of \\nwholesale brokers, managing general underwriters and program administrators, and o\\ufb00ers solutions for the unique \\nneeds of public entity, commercial and captive customers. \\nGeneral Re Group\\u2019s international reinsurance business is conducted on a direct basis through General \\nReinsurance AG, based in Cologne, Germany, and through subsidiaries and branches in numerous other countries. \\nInternational business is also written through brokers, including Faraday Underwriting Limited (\\u201cFaraday\\u201d), a \\nsubsidiary. Faraday owns the managing agent of Syndicate 435 at Lloyd\\u2019s of London and provides capacity and \\nparticipates in 100% of the results of Syndicate 435. \\nK-5 \\u00a0\\nThe TransRe Group provides pro-rata and excess-of-loss reinsurance across various property and casualty lines \\nof business. Contracts are written on both a treaty and facultative basis to insurance and other reinsurance \\ncompanies in the U.S. and in foreign markets through subsidiaries and branches in numerous countries. Business is \\nwritten primarily through brokers, and to a lesser extent on a direct basis.\\nLife/health \\nThe General Re Group conducts a global life and health reinsurance business. In the U.S. and internationally, \\nthe General Re Group writes life, disability, supplemental health, critical illness and long-term care coverages. The \\nlife/health business is marketed on a direct basis. Life/health net premiums written by the General Re Group in \\n2022 were primarily in the Asia Paci\\ufb01c, U.S. and Western Europe. \\nBerkshire Hathaway Life Insurance Company of Nebraska (\\u201cBHLN\\u201d) and its a\\ufb03liates write reinsurance covering \\nvarious forms of traditional life insurance exposures. BHLN and a\\ufb03liates are parties to contracts that reinsure \\ncertain guaranteed minimum death, income and similar bene\\ufb01t risks on closed-blocks of variable annuity risks \\nunder reinsurance contracts, with the most recent contract incepting in 2014. \\nRetroactive reinsurance \\nNICO also occasionally writes retroactive reinsurance contracts. Retroactive reinsurance contracts indemnify \\nceding companies against the adverse development of claims arising from loss events that have already occurred \\nunder property and casualty policies issued in prior years. Premiums from such contracts may be exceptionally \\nlarge in amount. Coverages under such contracts are provided on an excess basis (above a stated retention) or for \\nlosses payable after the inception of the contract with no additional ceding company retention. Contracts are \\nnormally subject to aggregate limits of indemni\\ufb01cation, which can be exceptionally large in amount. Signi\\ufb01cant \\namounts of asbestos, environmental and latent injury claims may arise under these contracts. \\nThe concept of time-value-of-money is an important element in establishing retroactive reinsurance contract \\nprices and terms since loss payments may occur over decades. Normally, expected ultimate losses payable under \\nthese policies are expected to exceed premiums, thus producing underwriting losses. Nevertheless, this business is \\nwritten, in part, because of the large amounts of policyholder funds generated for investment, the economic bene\\ufb01t \\nof which will be re\\ufb02ected through investment results in future periods. \\nPeriodic payment annuity \\nBHLN writes periodic payment annuity insurance policies and reinsures annuity-like obligations. Under these \\npolicies, BHLN receives upfront consideration and agrees in the future to make periodic payments that often extend \\nfor decades. These policies generally relate to the settlement of underlying personal injury or workers\\u2019 \\ncompensation claims of other insurers, known as structured settlements. Consistent with retroactive reinsurance \\ncontracts, time-value-of-money is an important factor in establishing annuity premiums, and underwriting losses \\nare expected from the periodic accretion of time-value discounted liabilities. \\nInvestments of insurance businesses\\u2014Berkshire\\u2019s insurance subsidiaries hold signi\\ufb01cant levels of \\ninvested assets. Investment portfolios are managed by Berkshire\\u2019s Chief Executive O\\ufb03cer and Berkshire\\u2019s other \\ninvestment managers. Investments include a very large portfolio of publicly traded equity securities, which is \\nunusually concentrated in relatively few issuers, as well as \\ufb01xed maturity securities and cash and short-term \\ninvestments. Generally, there are no targeted allocations by investment type or attempts to match investment \\nasset and insurance liability durations. However, investment portfolios have historically included a much greater \\nproportion of equity securities than is customary in the insurance industry. \\nInvested assets derive from shareholder capital as well as funds provided from policyholders through \\ninsurance and reinsurance business (\\u201c\\ufb02oat\\u201d). Float is an approximation of the net policyholder funds generated \\nthrough underwriting activities that is held for investment. The major components of \\ufb02oat are unpaid losses and \\nloss adjustment expenses, life, annuity and health bene\\ufb01t liabilities, unearned premiums and other policyholder \\nliabilities less premium and reinsurance receivables, deferred policy acquisition costs and deferred charges on \\nassumed retroactive reinsurance contracts. On a consolidated basis, \\ufb02oat has grown from approximately $114 \\nbillion at the end of 2017 to approximately $164 billion at the end of 2022. The cost of \\ufb02oat can be measured as \\nthe net pre-tax underwriting loss as a percentage of average \\ufb02oat. The cost of \\ufb02oat was nominal in 2022, re\\ufb02ecting \\na small underwriting loss. In 2021 and 2020, the cost of \\ufb02oat was negative, re\\ufb02ecting underwriting earnings in each \\nof those years. \\nRailroad Business\\u2014Burlington Northern Santa Fe \\nBurlington Northern Santa Fe, LLC (\\u201cBNSF\\u201d) is based in Fort Worth, Texas, and through BNSF Railway Company \\n(\\u201cBNSF Railway\\u201d) operates one of the largest railroad systems in North America. BNSF Railway had approximately \\n36,000 employees at the end of 2022, of whom approximately 31,000 were members of a labor union. BNSF also \\noperates a relatively smaller third-party logistics services business.\\nK-6 \\u00a0\\nIn serving the Midwest, Paci\\ufb01c Northwest, Western, Southwestern and Southeastern regions and ports of the \\nU.S., BNSF transports a range of products and commodities derived from manufacturing, agricultural and natural \\nresource industries. Freight revenues are covered by contractual agreements of varying durations or common \\ncarrier published prices or company quotations. BNSF\\u2019s \\ufb01nancial performance is in\\ufb02uenced by, among other things, \\ngeneral and industry economic conditions at the international, national and regional levels. \\nBNSF\\u2019s primary routes, including trackage rights, allow it to access major cities and ports in the western and \\nsouthern U.S. as well as parts of Canada and Mexico. In addition to major cities and ports, BNSF Railway e\\ufb03ciently \\nserves many smaller markets by working closely with approximately 200 shortline railroads. BNSF Railway has also \\nentered into marketing agreements with other rail carriers, expanding the marketing reach for each railroad and \\ntheir customers. For the year ending December 31, 2022, 38% of freight revenues were derived from consumer \\nproducts, 23% from industrial products, 23% from agricultural products and 16% from coal.\\nRegulatory Matters \\nBNSF is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations generally applicable to its businesses. Rail \\noperations are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board (\\u201cSTB\\u201d), the Federal \\nRailroad Administration of the United States Department of Transportation (\\u201cDOT\\u201d), the Occupational Safety and \\nHealth Administration (\\u201cOSHA\\u201d), the Environmental Protection Agency (\\u201cEPA\\u201d), as well as other federal and state \\nregulatory agencies and Canadian regulatory agencies for operations in Canada. The STB has jurisdiction over \\ndisputes and complaints involving certain rates, routes and services, the sale or abandonment of rail lines, \\napplications for line extensions and construction, and the merger with or acquisition of control of rail common \\ncarriers. The outcome of STB proceedings can a\\ufb00ect the pro\\ufb01tability of BNSF Railway\\u2019s business. \\nThe DOT, OSHA, and EPA have jurisdiction under several federal statutes over a number of safety, health, and \\nenvironmental aspects of rail operations, including the transportation of hazardous materials. BNSF Railway is \\nrequired to transport these materials to the extent of its common carrier obligation. State agencies regulate some \\nhealth, safety, and environmental aspects of rail operations in areas not otherwise preempted by federal law.\\nEnvironmental Matters \\nBNSF\\u2019s rail operations, as well as those of its competitors, are also subject to extensive federal, state and local \\nenvironmental regulations covering discharges to the ground or waters, air emissions, toxic substances and the \\ngeneration, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of waste and hazardous materials. Such regulations \\ne\\ufb00ectively increase the costs and liabilities associated with rail operations. Environmental risks are also inherent in \\nrail operations, which frequently involve transporting chemicals and other hazardous materials. \\nMany of BNSF\\u2019s land holdings are or have been used for industrial or transportation-related purposes or leased \\nto commercial or industrial companies whose activities may have resulted in discharges onto the property. Under \\nfederal (in particular, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act) and state \\nstatutes, BNSF may be held jointly and severally liable for cleanup and enforcement costs associated with a \\nparticular site without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct. BNSF may also be subject to claims by \\nthird parties for investigation, cleanup, restoration or other environmental costs under environmental statutes or \\ncommon law with respect to properties they own that have been impacted by BNSF operations. \\nConsumption of diesel fuel by locomotives accounted for approximately 80% of BNSF\\u2019s greenhouse gas \\n(\\u201cGHG\\u201d) emissions in its baseline year of 2018. BNSF management has committed to a broad sustainability model, \\napplying science based approaches, that will provide a 30% reduction in BNSF\\u2019s GHG-emissions by 2030 from its \\nbaseline year of 2018. BNSF intends to continue improvements in fuel e\\ufb03ciency and increased utilization of \\nrenewable diesel fuel. Long-term solutions, such as battery-electric and hydrogen locomotives, are also being \\nevaluated and \\ufb01eld-tested.\\nCompetition \\nThe business environment in which BNSF operates is highly competitive. Depending on the speci\\ufb01c market, \\nderegulated motor carriers and other railroads, as well as river barges, ships and pipelines, may exert pressure on \\nprice and service levels. The presence of advanced, high service truck lines with expedited delivery, subsidized \\ninfrastructure and minimal empty mileage continues to a\\ufb00ect the market for non-bulk, time-sensitive freight. The \\npotential expansion of longer combination vehicles could further encroach upon markets traditionally served by \\nrailroads. In order to remain competitive, BNSF Railway and other railroads seek to develop and implement \\noperating e\\ufb03ciencies to improve productivity. \\nAs railroads streamline, rationalize and otherwise enhance their franchises, competition among rail carriers \\nintensi\\ufb01es. BNSF Railway\\u2019s primary rail competitor in the Western region of the U.S. is the Union Paci\\ufb01c Railroad \\nCompany. Other Class I railroads and numerous regional railroads and motor carriers also operate in parts of the \\nsame territories served by BNSF Railway. \\nK-7 \\u00a0\\nUtilities and Energy Businesses\\u2014Berkshire Hathaway Energy \\nBerkshire currently holds a 92% ownership interest in Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (\\u201cBHE\\u201d), based in \\nDes Moines, Iowa. BHE is a global energy company with subsidiaries and a\\ufb03liates that generate, transmit, store, \\ndistribute and supply energy. BHE\\u2019s domestic regulated energy interests are comprised of four regulated U.S. utility \\ncompanies (collectively, \\u201cU.S. utilities\\u201d) serving approximately 5.2 million retail customers and \\ufb01ve U.S. interstate \\nnatural gas pipeline companies with approximately 21,200 miles of operated pipeline having a design capacity of \\napproximately 21 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day.

Kern River transports natural gas for electric and natural gas distribution utilities, major oil and natural \\ngas companies or a\\ufb03liates of such companies, electric generating companies, energy marketing and trading \\ncompanies, and \\ufb01nancial institutions. \\nK-8 \\u00a0\\nOther energy businesses include Northern Powergrid (Northeast) plc and Northern Powergrid (Yorkshire) plc, \\nwhich own a substantial electricity distribution network that delivers electricity to end-users in northeast England in \\nan area covering approximately 10,000 square miles. These distribution companies primarily charge supply \\ncompanies regulated tari\\ufb00s for the use of their distribution systems and serve about 4.0 million electricity end-\\nusers. AltaLink L.P. (\\u201cAltaLink\\u201d) is a regulated electric transmission-only utility company headquartered in Calgary, \\nAlberta. AltaLink\\u2019s high voltage transmission lines and related facilities transmit electricity from generating facilities \\nto major load centers, cities and large industrial plants throughout its 87,000 square mile service territory. AltaLink \\nserves approximately 85% of Alberta\\u2019s population. BHE and its subsidiaries, also own interests in independent \\npower projects having approximately 6,000 net megawatts of generation capacity that are in service in California, \\nTexas, Illinois, Nebraska, Montana, Australia, New York, Arizona, Canada, Minnesota, Kansas, Iowa and Hawaii. \\nThese independent power projects sell power generated primarily from wind, solar, geothermal and hydro sources \\nunder long-term contracts. Additionally, $7.3 billion has been invested in wind projects sponsored by third parties, \\ncommonly referred to as tax equity investments.\\nRegulatory Matters \\nThe U.S. utilities are subject to comprehensive regulation by various federal, state and local agencies. The \\nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission (\\u201cFERC\\u201d) is an independent agency with broad authority to implement \\nprovisions of the Federal Power Act, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and other federal statutes. The FERC regulates \\nrates for wholesale sales of electricity; transmission of electricity, including pricing and regional planning for the \\nexpansion of transmission systems; electric system reliability; utility holding companies; accounting and records \\nretention; securities issuances; construction and operation of hydroelectric facilities; and other matters. The FERC \\nalso has the enforcement authority to assess civil penalties of up to $1.5 million per day per violation of rules, \\nregulations and orders issued under the Federal Power Act. MEC is also subject to regulation by the Nuclear \\nRegulatory Commission pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, with respect to its 25% ownership \\nof the Quad Cities Nuclear Station. \\nWith certain limited exceptions, the U.S. utilities have an exclusive right to serve retail customers within their \\nservice territories and, in turn, have an obligation to provide service to those customers. In some jurisdictions, \\ncertain classes of customers may choose to purchase all or a portion of their energy from alternative energy \\nsuppliers, and in some jurisdictions retail customers can generate all or a portion of their own energy. Historically, \\nstate regulatory commissions have established retail electric and natural gas rates on a cost-of-service basis, which \\nare designed to allow a utility the opportunity to recover what each state regulatory commission deems to be the \\nutility\\u2019s reasonable costs of providing services, including a fair opportunity to earn a reasonable return on its \\ninvestments based on its cost of debt and equity. The retail electric rates of U.S. utilities are generally based on the \\ncost of providing traditional bundled services, including generation, transmission and distribution services; \\nhowever, rates are available for transmission-only and distribution-only services. \\nNorthern Powergrid (Northeast) plc and Northern Powergrid (Yorkshire) plc each charge fees for the use of \\ntheir distribution systems that are controlled by a formula prescribed by the British electricity regulatory body, the \\nGas and Electricity Markets Authority. The current eight-year price control period runs from April 1, 2015 through \\nMarch 31, 2023 and the next price control period is set for the \\ufb01ve-year period ending March 31, 2028. \\nAltaLink is regulated by the Alberta Utilities Commission (\\u201cAUC\\u201d), pursuant to the Electric Utilities Act \\n(Alberta), the Public Utilities Act (Alberta), the Alberta Utilities Commission Act (Alberta) and the Hydro and Electric \\nEnergy Act (Alberta). The AUC is an independent quasi-judicial agency, which regulates and oversees Alberta\\u2019s \\nelectricity transmission sector with broad authority that may impact many of AltaLink\\u2019s activities, including its \\ntari\\ufb00s, rates, construction, operations and \\ufb01nancing. Under the Electric Utilities Act, AltaLink prepares and \\ufb01les \\napplications with the AUC for approval of tari\\ufb00s to be paid by the Alberta Electric System Operator (\\u201cAESO\\u201d) for the \\nuse of its transmission facilities, and the terms and conditions governing the use of those facilities. The AESO is an \\nindependent system operator in Alberta, Canada that oversees Alberta\\u2019s integrated electrical system (\\u201cAIES\\u201d) and \\nwholesale electricity market. The AESO is responsible for directing the safe, reliable and economic operation of the \\nAIES, including long-term transmission system planning. \\nThe natural gas pipelines are subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies. The natural gas \\npipeline and storage operations of BHE GT&S, Northern Natural and Kern River are regulated by the FERC pursuant \\nto the Natural Gas Act and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. Under this authority, the FERC regulates, among \\nother items, (a) rates, charges, terms and conditions of service; (b) the construction and operation of interstate \\npipelines, storage and related facilities, including the extension, expansion or abandonment of such facilities; and \\n(c) the construction and operation of lique\\ufb01ed natural gas export/import facilities. Interstate natural gas pipeline \\ncompanies are also subject to regulations administered by the O\\ufb03ce of Pipeline Safety within the Pipeline and \\nHazardous Materials Safety Administration, an agency of the DOT. Federal pipeline safety regulations are issued \\npursuant to the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, as amended, which establishes safety requirements in the \\ndesign, construction, operation and maintenance of interstate natural gas pipeline facilities. \\nK-9 \\u00a0\\nEnvironmental Matters \\nBHE and its energy businesses are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations regarding \\nair quality, climate change, emissions performance standards, water quality, coal ash disposal and other \\nenvironmental matters that have the potential to impact current and future operations. In addition to imposing \\ncontinuing compliance obligations, these laws and regulations, such as the Federal Clean Air Act, provide regulators \\nwith the authority to levy substantial penalties for noncompliance, including \\ufb01nes, injunctive relief and other \\nsanctions.\\nThe Federal Clean Air Act, as well as state laws and regulations impacting air emissions, provides a framework \\nfor protecting and improving the nation\\u2019s air quality and controlling sources of air emissions. These laws and \\nregulations continue to be promulgated and implemented and will impact the operation of BHE\\u2019s generating \\nfacilities and require them to reduce emissions at those facilities to comply with the requirements. In addition, the \\npotential adoption of state or federal clean energy standards, which include low-carbon, non-carbon and renewable \\nelectricity generating resources, may also impact electricity generators and natural gas providers. \\nIn December 2015, an international agreement was negotiated by 195 nations to create a universal \\nframework for coordinated action on climate change in what is referred to as the Paris Agreement. The Paris \\nAgreement rea\\ufb03rms the goal of limiting global temperature increase well below 2 degrees Celsius, while urging \\ne\\ufb00orts to limit the increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius and reaching a global peak of GHG emissions as soon as possible \\nto achieve climate neutrality by mid-century; establishes commitments by all parties to make nationally \\ndetermined contributions and pursue domestic measures aimed at achieving the commitments; commits all \\ncountries to submit emissions inventories and report regularly on their emissions and progress made in \\nimplementing and achieving their nationally determined commitments; and commits all countries to submit new \\ncommitments every \\ufb01ve years, with the expectation that the commitments will be more aggressive in reducing \\nGHG emissions. In the context of the Paris Agreement, the U.S. agreed to reduce GHG emissions by 26% to 28% \\nfrom 2005 levels by 2025. The Paris Agreement formally became e\\ufb00ective on November 4, 2016; however, the U.S. \\ncompleted its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on November 4, 2020. President Biden accepted the terms of \\nthe climate agreement on January 20, 2021, and the U.S. completed its reentry on February 19, 2021. New \\ncommitments to the Paris Agreement were announced in April 2021, with the U.S. pledging to cut its overall GHG \\nemissions by 50% to 52% from 2005 levels by 2030 and to reach 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035. \\nIncreasingly, states are adopting legislation and regulations to reduce GHG emissions, and local governments and \\nconsumers are seeking increasing amounts of clean and renewable energy.\\nOn June 19, 2019, the EPA repealed the Clean Power Plan and issued the A\\ufb00ordable Clean Energy rule. In the \\nA\\ufb00ordable Clean Energy rule, the EPA determined that the best system of emissions reduction for existing coal \\nfueled power plants is heat rate improvements and identi\\ufb01ed a set of candidate technologies and measures that \\ncould improve heat rates. Measures taken to meet the standards of performance must be achieved at the source \\nitself. On January 19, 2021, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the A\\ufb00ordable Clean Energy rule in its entirety. \\nIn October 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear an appeal of that decision. Arguments in the case were \\nheld in February 2022 and on June 30, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its decision regarding the scope of the \\nEPA\\u2019s authority to regulate GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act. The U.S. Supreme Court held that the \\n\\u201cgeneration shifting\\u201d approach in the Clean Power Plan exceeded the powers granted to the EPA by Congress, \\nalthough the court did not address whether the EPA may only adopt measures applied at the individual source as it \\ndid in the A\\ufb00ordable Clean Energy rule. The Biden administration plans to propose a replacement to the Clean \\nPower Plan and A\\ufb00ordable Clean Energy rule by April 2023. \\nIn November 2021, the EPA proposed rules that would reduce methane emissions from both new and existing \\nsources in the oil and natural gas industry. The proposals would expand and strengthen emission reduction \\nrequirements for new, modi\\ufb01ed and reconstructed oil and natural gas sources and would require states to reduce \\nmethane emissions from existing sources nationwide. The EPA issued a supplemental proposal in November 2022 \\nto further strengthen emission requirements and intends to \\ufb01nalize the rules by fall 2023.\\nBHE and its energy subsidiaries continue to focus on delivering reliable, a\\ufb00ordable, safe and clean energy to \\nits customers and on actions to mitigate its GHG emissions. BHE\\u2019s primary source of GHG emissions is the \\ngeneration of electricity from its power plants that are fueled by coal or natural gas. In managing its electricity \\ngeneration, BHE works with its regulators to protect the energy and economic needs of customers by considering \\ncosts, reliability and sources of electric generation. Over the years, BHE has invested heavily in owned wind, solar \\nand geothermal generation, with cumulative investments of $31.6 billion through 2022 and has retired 16 coal \\ngeneration units. As a result, as of December 31, 2022, BHE reduced its annual GHG emissions by more than 27% \\nas compared to 2005 levels. BHE plans to continue investing in wind, solar and other low-carbon generation in the \\nfuture and to retire an additional 16 coal generation units between 2023 and 2030 in a reliable and cost-e\\ufb00ective \\nmanner, thereby achieving a 50% reduction in GHG emissions from 2005 levels in 2030. \\nK-10 \\u00a0\\nNon-Energy Businesses \\nHomeServices of America, Inc. (\\u201cHomeServices\\u201d) is a residential real estate brokerage \\ufb01rm in the U.S. In \\naddition to providing traditional residential real estate brokerage services, HomeServices o\\ufb00ers other integrated \\nreal estate services, including mortgage originations and mortgage banking, title and closing services, insurance, \\nhome warranties, relocation services and other home-related services. It operates under 55 brand names with \\napproximately 45,000 real estate agents in nearly 930 brokerage o\\ufb03ces in 33 states and the District of Columbia. \\nHomeServices\\u2019 franchise network currently includes approximately 300 franchisees and over 1,500 brokerage \\no\\ufb03ces with nearly 51,000 real estate agents under two brand names, primarily in the U.S. In exchange for certain \\nfees, HomeServices provides the right to use the Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices or Real Living brand names \\nand other related service marks, as well as providing orientation programs, training and consultation services, \\nadvertising programs and other services.\\nHomeServices\\u2019 principal sources of revenue are dependent on residential real estate sales, which are \\ngenerally higher in the second and third quarters of each year. This business is highly competitive and subject to \\ngeneral real estate market conditions. \\nManufacturing Businesses \\nBerkshire\\u2019s numerous and diverse manufacturing subsidiaries are grouped into three categories: (1) industrial \\nproducts, (2) building products and (3) consumer products. Berkshire\\u2019s industrial products businesses manufacture \\ncomponents for aerospace and power generation applications, specialty chemicals, metal cutting tools, and a \\nvariety of other products primarily for industrial use. The building products group produces prefabricated and site-\\nbuilt residential homes, \\ufb02ooring products, insulation, roo\\ufb01ng and engineered products, building and engineered \\ncomponents, paint and coatings and bricks and masonry products. The consumer products group manufactures and \\ndistributes recreational vehicles, batteries, and various apparel, footwear and other products. Information \\nconcerning the major activities of these three groups follows. Berkshire\\u2019s manufacturing businesses employed \\napproximately 191,000 people at the end of 2022.\\nIndustrial products \\nPrecision Castparts \\nPrecision Castparts Corp. (\\u201cPCC\\u201d), based in Lake Oswego, Oregon, manufactures complex metal components \\nand products, provides high-quality investment castings, forgings, fasteners/fastener systems and aerostructures \\nfor critical aerospace and power and energy applications. PCC also manufactures investment castings and forgings \\nfor general industrial, armament, medical and other applications; nickel and titanium alloys in all standard mill \\nforms from large ingots and billets to plate, foil, sheet, strip, tubing, bar, rod, extruded shapes, rod-in-coil, wire and \\nwelding consumables, as well as cobalt alloys, for the aerospace, chemical processing, oil and gas, pollution control \\nand other industries; fasteners for automotive and general industrial markets; specialty alloys for the investment \\ncasting and forging industries; heat treating and destructive testing services for the investment cast products and \\nforging industries; grinder pumps and a\\ufb03liated components for low-pressure sewer systems; critical auxiliary \\nequipment and gas monitoring systems for the power generation industry; and metalworking tools for the fastener \\nmarket and other applications. \\nInvestment casting technology involves a multi-step process that uses ceramic molds in the manufacture of \\nmetal components with more complex shapes, closer tolerances and \\ufb01ner surface \\ufb01nishes than parts manufactured \\nusing other methods. PCC uses this process to manufacture products for aircraft engines, industrial gas turbine and \\nother aeroderivative engines, airframes, medical implants, armament, unmanned aerial vehicles and other \\nindustrial applications. PCC also manufactures high temperature carbon and ceramic composite components, \\nincluding ceramic matrix composites, for use in next-generation aerospace engines.\\nPCC uses forging processes to manufacture components for the aerospace and power generation markets. \\nPCC manufactures high-performance, nickel-based alloys, as well as titanium alloys and products. PCC\\u2019s nickel-\\nbased alloys are used to produce forged components and investment castings for aerospace and non-aerospace \\napplications in such markets as oil and gas, chemical processing and pollution control. PCC\\u2019s titanium products are \\nused to manufacture components for the commercial and military aerospace, power generation, energy, medical, \\nand industrial end markets.\\nPCC is also a leading developer and manufacturer of highly engineered fasteners, fastener systems, \\naerostructures and precision components, primarily for critical aerospace applications. These products are \\nproduced for the aerospace and power and energy markets, as well as for construction, automotive, heavy truck, \\nfarm machinery, mining and construction equipment, shipbuilding, machine tools, medical equipment, appliances \\nand recreation markets. \\nK-11 \\u00a0\\nPCC has several signi\\ufb01cant customers, including aerospace original equipment manufacturers (\\u201cOEMs\\u201d) \\n(Boeing and Airbus) and aircraft engine manufacturer suppliers (General Electric, Rolls Royce and Pratt &Whitney). \\nThe majority of PCC\\u2019s sales are from customer orders or demand schedules pursuant to long-term agreements. \\nContractual terms may provide for termination by the customer, subject to payment for work performed. PCC \\ntypically does not experience signi\\ufb01cant order cancellations, although periodically it receives requests for delays in \\ndelivery schedules.\\nThe e\\ufb00ects of the COVID-19 pandemic produced signi\\ufb01cant adverse e\\ufb00ects on the PCC aerospace business in \\n2020 and 2021. The sudden and material reductions in air travel led to aircraft build rate reductions and customer \\ndestocking at extraordinary rates. Further, production delays in Boeing\\u2019s 737 MAX and 787 programs during this \\ntime also adversely impacted PCC over the past three years. \\nWhile commercial air travel increased in both the U.S. and international markets during 2022, tra\\ufb03c remains \\nbelow pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels, especially for international routes. Further recovery could be uneven, in the \\nevent of new COVID-19 variant developments and related travel restrictions, as well as from the changes in supply \\nchain conditions, including the availability of workers. Commercial aircraft delivery rates by OEMs of narrow-body \\naircraft have rebounded since the onset of the pandemic. However, deliveries of wide-body aircraft remain \\nrelatively low, in part attributable to the pause in the Boeing 787 program, which resumed deliveries in the third \\nquarter of 2022. Long-term industry forecasts continue to show growth and strong demand for air travel and \\naerospace products. \\nPCC is subject to substantial competition in all of its markets. Components and similar products may be \\nproduced by competitors, who use either the same types of manufacturing processes as PCC or other processes. \\nAlthough PCC believes its manufacturing processes, technology and experience provide its customers advantages, \\nsuch as high quality, competitive prices and physical properties that often meet more stringent demands, \\nalternative forms of manufacturing can be used to produce many of the same components and products. \\nNevertheless, PCC is a leading supplier in most of its principal markets. Several factors, including long-standing \\ncustomer relationships, technical expertise, state-of-the-art facilities and dedicated employees, aid PCC in \\nmaintaining competitive advantages.\\nSeveral raw materials used in PCC products, including certain metals such as nickel, titanium, cobalt, tantalum \\nand molybdenum, are found in only a few parts of the world. These metals are required for the alloys used in \\nmanufactured products. The availability and costs of these metals may be in\\ufb02uenced by private or governmental \\ncartels, changes in world politics, labor relations between the metal producers and their workforces and in\\ufb02ation. \\nPCC is currently subject to various federal, state and foreign environmental laws concerning, among other \\nthings, water discharges, air emissions, waste management, toxic materials use reduction and environmental \\ncleanup. Laws and regulations continue to evolve, and it is reasonably possible that environmental standards will \\nbecome more stringent in the future, particularly under air quality and water quality laws and standards related to \\nclimate change, including reporting of GHG emissions. As a result, it is also reasonably likely that PCC will be \\nregularly required to make additional expenditures, including capital expenditures, which could be signi\\ufb01cant, \\nrelating to environmental matters.\\nLubrizol \\nThe Lubrizol Corporation (\\u201cLubrizol\\u201d), headquartered in Wickli\\ufb00e, Ohio, is a specialty chemical and \\nperformance materials company that manufactures products and supplies technologies for the global \\ntransportation, industrial and consumer markets. Lubrizol currently operates two business segments: Lubrizol \\nAdditives, which produces engine lubricant additives, driveline lubricant additives and industrial specialties \\nproducts; and Lubrizol Advanced Materials, which includes engineered materials (engineered polymers and \\nperformance coatings) and life sciences (beauty and personal care, and health and home care solutions). \\nLubrizol Additives\\u2019 products are used in a broad range of applications including engine oils, transmission \\n\\ufb02uids, gear oils, specialty driveline lubricants, fuels, metalworking \\ufb02uids and compressor lubricants for \\ntransportation and industrial applications. Lubrizol Advanced Materials\\u2019 products are used in many di\\ufb00erent types of \\napplications including beauty, personal care, home care, over-the-counter pharmaceuticals, medical devices, \\nperformance coatings, sporting goods, plumbing and \\ufb01re sprinkler systems. Lubrizol is an industry leader in many \\nof the markets in which it competes, and its principal lubricant additives competitors are In\\ufb01neum International \\nLtd., Chevron Oronite Company and Afton Chemical Corporation. Lubrizol Advanced Materials\\u2019 businesses compete \\nin many markets with a variety of competitors in each product line. \\nWith its considerable patent portfolio, Lubrizol uses its technological leadership position and applies its \\nscience capabilities, formulation know-how and market expertise in product development to improve the demand, \\nquality and value of its solutions. Lubrizol also leverages its scienti\\ufb01c and applications knowledge to meet and \\nexceed customer performance and sustainability requirements. While Lubrizol typically has patents that expire \\neach year, it invests resources to protect its intellectual property and to develop or acquire innovative products for \\nthe markets it serves. Lubrizol uses many specialty and commodity chemical raw materials in its manufacturing \\nprocesses. Raw materials are primarily feedstocks derived from petroleum and petrochemicals and, generally, are \\nobtainable from several sources. The materials that Lubrizol chooses to purchase from a single source typically are \\nsubject to long-term supply contracts to ensure supply reliability. \\nK-12 \\u00a0\\nLubrizol operates its business on a global basis through more than 100 o\\ufb03ces, laboratories, production \\nfacilities and warehouses on six continents, the most signi\\ufb01cant of which are North America, Europe, Asia and \\nSouth America. Lubrizol markets its products worldwide through direct sales, sales agents and distributors. \\nLubrizol\\u2019s customers principally consist of major global and regional oil companies and industrial and consumer \\nproducts companies. Some of Lubrizol\\u2019s largest customers also may be suppliers. During 2022, no single customer \\naccounted for more than 10% of Lubrizol\\u2019s consolidated revenues. In recent years, the COVID-19 pandemic, supply \\nchain disruptions, severe weather and \\ufb01res at certain Lubrizol facilities a\\ufb00ected the availability of raw materials and \\nful\\ufb01llment of customer orders and otherwise disrupted Lubrizol\\u2019s operations. \\nLubrizol expends signi\\ufb01cant capital to ensure the safety of its employees and the communities where it \\noperates, as well as delivering on its commitments to operational excellence and cybersecurity. Lubrizol also makes \\nsigni\\ufb01cant capital investments to ensure reliable supply and compliance with regulations governing its operations, \\nwhile reducing their environmental footprint. \\nLubrizol is subject to foreign, federal, state and local laws to protect the environment, limit manufacturing \\nwaste and emissions, ensure product and employee safety and regulate trade. While the company believes that its \\npolicies, practices and procedures are designed to limit the associated risks and consequent \\ufb01nancial liability, the \\noperation of chemical manufacturing plants entails inherent environmental, safety and other risks, and signi\\ufb01cant \\ncapital expenditures, costs or liabilities could be incurred in the future.\\nIMC International Metalworking Companies\\nIMC International Metalworking Companies (\\u201cIMC\\u201d) is one of the three largest multinational manufacturers of \\nconsumable precision carbide metal cutting tools for applications in a broad range of industrial end markets.

Clayton also o\\ufb00ers home \\ufb01nancing and insurance products and competes on price, service, location and \\ndelivery capabilities. \\nAll Clayton Built\\u00ae o\\ufb00-site built homes are designed, engineered and assembled in the U.S. As of December \\n2022, o\\ufb00-site backlog was $256 million, down 82% from the prior year end. Clayton sells o\\ufb00-site built homes \\nthrough independent and company-owned home centers, realtors and subdivision channels. Clayton considers its \\nability to o\\ufb00er \\ufb01nancing to retail purchasers a factor a\\ufb00ecting the marketplace acceptance of its o\\ufb00-site built \\nhomes. Clayton\\u2019s \\ufb01nancing programs utilize proprietary loan underwriting guidelines to evaluate loan applicants.\\nSince 2015, Clayton\\u2019s site-built division, Clayton Properties Group, has expanded through the acquisition of \\nnine builders across 18 states with over 310 subdivisions, supplementing the portfolio of housing products o\\ufb00ered \\nto customers.

During \\n2021 and the \\ufb01rst half of 2022, the availability and pricing of these and other inputs was volatile. Input shortages \\ncoupled with reduced labor and subcontractor availability increased the time needed to construct a home, \\nincreasing the levels of work-in-process inventory. These constraints began to lessen in the latter half of 2022 due \\nto improved availability and pricing of key inputs, increased order cancellations and lower overall demand for new \\nhome construction. \\nClayton\\u2019s building products business has bene\\ufb01ted in recent years from the low interest rate environment. \\nHowever, interest rates in the U.S. increased signi\\ufb01cantly during 2022, which contributed to slowing demand for \\nnew home construction. \\nClayton\\u2019s home building business regularly makes capital and non-capital expenditures with respect to \\ncompliance with federal, state and local environmental regulations, primarily related to erosion control, permitting \\nand stormwater protection for site-built home subdivisions. The \\ufb01nancing business originates and services loans \\nwhich are federally regulated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, various state regulatory agencies and \\nreviewed by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Government National Mortgage \\nAssociation and government-sponsored enterprises. \\nShaw \\nShaw Industries Group, Inc.

During 2022, Shaw processed approximately 89% of its requirements for carpet yarn \\nin its own yarn processing facilities. The availability of raw materials is adequate, but costs are impacted by petro-\\nchemical and natural gas price changes. A signi\\ufb01cant portion of Shaw\\u2019s soft-\\ufb02ooring raw materials derive from \\nrecycled sources. Raw material cost changes are periodically factored into selling prices to customers. \\nThe soft \\ufb02oor covering industry is highly competitive with only a handful of major competitors domestically. \\nThere are numerous manufacturers, domestically and internationally, that are engaged in the hard surfaces \\ufb02ooring \\nsector. According to industry estimates, carpet accounts for approximately 41% of the total U.S. consumption of all \\n\\ufb02ooring types. The principal competitive measures within the \\ufb02oor covering industry are quality, style, price and \\nservice. \\nJohns Manville \\nJohns Manville Corporation (\\u201cJM\\u201d), headquartered in Denver, Colorado, is a leading manufacturer and marketer \\nof premium-quality products for building insulation, mechanical and industrial insulation, commercial roo\\ufb01ng and \\nroof insulation, as well as reinforcement \\ufb01berglass and technical nonwovens.

Berkshire\\u2019s retailing businesses employed approximately 26,000 people at the end of \\n2022. Information regarding each of these operations follows. \\nBerkshire Hathaway Automotive \\nBerkshire Hathaway Automotive, Inc. (\\u201cBHA\\u201d) is one of the largest automotive retailers in the U.S., currently \\noperating 106 new vehicle franchises through 83 dealerships located primarily in major metropolitan markets in the \\nU.S. The dealerships sell new and used vehicles, vehicle maintenance and repair services, extended service \\ncontracts, vehicle protection products and other aftermarket products. BHA also arranges \\ufb01nancing for its \\ncustomers through third-party lenders. BHA operates 28 collision centers directly connected to the dealerships\\u2019 \\noperations and owns and operates two auto auctions and an automotive \\ufb02uid maintenance products distributor. \\nDealership operations are highly concentrated in the Arizona and Texas markets, with approximately 75% of \\ndealership-related revenues derived from sales in these markets. BHA currently maintains franchise agreements \\nwith 27 di\\ufb00erent vehicle manufacturers, although it derives a signi\\ufb01cant portion of its revenue from the \\nToyota/Lexus, General Motors, Ford/Lincoln, Nissan/In\\ufb01niti and Honda/Acura brands. Approximately 90% of BHA\\u2019s \\nannual revenues are from dealerships representing these manufacturers. \\nThe retail automotive industry is highly competitive. BHA faces competition from other large public and \\nprivate dealership groups, as well as individual franchised dealerships and competition via the Internet. Given the \\npricing transparency available via the Internet, and the fact that franchised dealers acquire vehicles from the \\nmanufacturers on the same terms irrespective of volume, the location and quality of the dealership facility, \\ncustomer service and transaction speed are key di\\ufb00erentiators in attracting customers. \\nBHA\\u2019s overall relationships with the automobile manufacturers are governed by framework agreements. The \\nframework agreements contain provisions relating to the management, operation, acquisition and ownership \\nstructure of BHA\\u2019s dealerships. Failure to meet the terms of these agreements could adversely impact BHA\\u2019s ability \\nto acquire additional dealerships representing those manufacturers. Additionally, these agreements contain \\nlimitations on the number of dealerships from a speci\\ufb01c manufacturer that may be owned by BHA. \\nIndividual dealerships operate under franchise agreements with the manufacturer, which grants the \\ndealership entity a non-exclusive right to sell the manufacturer\\u2019s brand of vehicles and o\\ufb00er related parts and \\nservice within a speci\\ufb01ed market area, as well as the right to use the manufacturer\\u2019s trademarks. The agreements \\ncontain various requirements and restrictions related to the management and operation of the franchised \\ndealership and provide for termination of the agreement by the manufacturer or non-renewal for a variety of \\ncauses. States generally have automotive dealership franchise laws that provide substantial protection to the \\nfranchisee, and it is di\\ufb03cult for a manufacturer to terminate or not renew a franchise agreement outside of \\nbankruptcy or with \\u201cgood cause\\u201d under the applicable state franchise law. \\nBHA also develops, underwrites and administers various vehicle protection plans as well as life and accident \\nand health insurance plans sold to consumers through BHA\\u2019s dealerships and third-party dealerships. BHA also \\ndevelops proprietary training programs and materials and provides ongoing monitoring and training of the \\ndealership\\u2019s \\ufb01nance and insurance personnel. \\nHome furnishings retailing \\nThe home furnishings businesses consist of Nebraska Furniture Mart Inc.

Risk Factors \\nBerkshire and its subsidiaries (referred to herein as \\u201cwe,\\u201d \\u201cus,\\u201d \\u201cour\\u201d or similar expressions) are subject to \\ncertain risks and uncertainties in its business operations which are described below. The risks and uncertainties \\ndescribed below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that are presently unknown or are \\ncurrently deemed immaterial may also impair our business operations. \\nGeneral Business Risks \\nTerrorist acts could hurt our operating businesses. \\nA cyber, biological, nuclear or chemical terrorist attack could produce signi\\ufb01cant losses to our worldwide \\noperations. Our business operations could be adversely a\\ufb00ected from such acts through the loss of human \\nresources or destruction of production facilities and information systems. We share the risk with all businesses. \\nCyber security risks \\nWe rely on technology in virtually all aspects of our business. Like those of many large businesses, certain of \\nour information systems have been subject to computer viruses, malicious codes, unauthorized access, phishing \\ne\\ufb00orts, denial-of-service attacks and other cyber-attacks. We expect to be subject to similar attacks in the future as \\nsuch attacks become more sophisticated and frequent. A signi\\ufb01cant disruption or failure of our technology systems \\ncould result in service interruptions, safety failures, security events, regulatory compliance failures, an inability to \\nprotect information and assets against unauthorized users and other operational di\\ufb03culties. Attacks perpetrated \\nagainst our systems could result in loss of assets and critical information and expose us to remediation costs and \\nreputational damage. \\nAlthough we have taken steps intended to mitigate these risks, including business continuity planning, \\ndisaster recovery planning and business impact analysis, a signi\\ufb01cant disruption or cyber intrusion at one or more \\nof our signi\\ufb01cant operations could adversely a\\ufb00ect our results of operations, \\ufb01nancial condition and liquidity. \\nAdditionally, if we are unable to acquire, develop, implement, adopt or protect rights around new technology, we \\nmay su\\ufb00er a competitive disadvantage, which could also have an adverse e\\ufb00ect on our results of operations, \\n\\ufb01nancial condition and/or liquidity. \\nCyber-attacks could further adversely a\\ufb00ect our ability to operate facilities, information technology and \\nbusiness systems or compromise con\\ufb01dential customer and employee information. Political, economic, social or \\n\\ufb01nancial market instability or damage to or interference with our operating assets, customers or suppliers from \\ncyber-attacks may result in business interruptions, lost revenues, higher commodity prices, disruption in fuel \\nsupplies, lower energy consumption, unstable markets, increased security, repair or other costs, or may materially \\nadversely a\\ufb00ect us in ways that cannot be predicted at this time. Any of these risks could materially a\\ufb00ect our \\nconsolidated \\ufb01nancial results. Furthermore, instability in the \\ufb01nancial markets resulting from terrorism, sustained or \\nsigni\\ufb01cant cyber-attacks or war could also have a material adverse e\\ufb00ect on our ability to raise capital. We share \\nthese risks with all businesses. \\nWe are dependent on a few key people for our major investment and capital allocation decisions. \\nMajor investment decisions and all major capital allocation decisions are made by Warren E. Bu\\ufb00ett, Chairman \\nof the Board of Directors and Chief Executive O\\ufb03cer, age 92, in consultation with Charles T. Munger, Vice Chairman \\nof the Board of Directors, age 99. In 2018, Berkshire\\u2019s Board of Directors appointed Mr. Gregory Abel as Vice \\nChairman of Berkshire\\u2019s non-insurance operations and Mr. Ajit Jain as Vice Chairman of Berkshire\\u2019s insurance \\noperations. Mr. Abel and Mr. Jain each report directly to Mr. Bu\\ufb00ett. Mr. Bu\\ufb00ett continues to be responsible for major \\ncapital allocation and investment decisions.\\nIf for any reason the services of our key personnel, particularly Mr. Bu\\ufb00ett, were to become unavailable, there \\ncould be a material adverse e\\ufb00ect on our operations. Should a replacement for Mr. Bu\\ufb00ett be needed currently, \\nBerkshire\\u2019s Board of Directors has agreed that Mr. Abel should replace Mr. Bu\\ufb00ett. The Board continually monitors \\nthis risk and could alter its current view regarding a replacement for Mr. Bu\\ufb00ett in the future. We believe that the \\nBoard\\u2019s succession plan, together with the outstanding managers running our numerous and highly diversi\\ufb01ed \\noperating units helps to mitigate this risk. \\nWe need quali\\ufb01ed personnel to manage and operate our various businesses. \\nIn our decentralized business model, we need quali\\ufb01ed and competent management to direct day-to-day \\nbusiness activities of our operating subsidiaries and to manage changes in future business operations due to \\nchanging business or regulatory environments. Our operating subsidiaries also need quali\\ufb01ed and competent \\npersonnel to execute business plans and serve their customers, suppliers and other stakeholders. Our inability to \\nrecruit, train and retain quali\\ufb01ed and competent managers and personnel could negatively a\\ufb00ect the operating \\nresults, \\ufb01nancial condition and liquidity of our subsidiaries and Berkshire as a whole. \\nK-25 \\u00a0\\nInvestments are unusually concentrated in equity securities and fair values are subject to loss in \\nvalue. \\nWe concentrate a high percentage of the equity security investments of our insurance subsidiaries in a \\nrelatively small number of issuers. A signi\\ufb01cant decline in the fair values of our larger investments in equity \\nsecurities may produce a material decline in our consolidated shareholders\\u2019 equity and our consolidated earnings. \\nSince a large percentage of our equity securities are held by our insurance subsidiaries, signi\\ufb01cant decreases \\nin the fair values of these investments will produce signi\\ufb01cant declines in the statutory surplus of our insurance \\nsubsidiaries. Our large statutory surplus is a competitive advantage, and a long-term material decline could have \\nan adverse e\\ufb00ect on our claims-paying ability ratings and our ability to write new insurance business thus \\npotentially reducing our future underwriting pro\\ufb01ts. \\nCompetition and technology may erode our business franchises and result in lower earnings. \\nEach of our operating businesses face intense competition within markets in which they operate. While we \\nmanage our businesses with the objective of achieving long-term sustainable growth by developing and \\nstrengthening competitive advantages, many factors, including technological changes, may erode or prevent the \\nstrengthening of competitive advantages. Accordingly, our future operating results will depend to some degree on \\nour operating units successfully protecting and enhancing their competitive advantages. If our operating \\nbusinesses are unsuccessful in these e\\ufb00orts, our periodic operating results in the future may decline.  \\nUnfavorable general economic conditions may signi\\ufb01cantly reduce our operating earnings and impair \\nour ability to access capital markets at a reasonable cost. \\nOur operating businesses are subject to normal economic cycles a\\ufb00ecting the general economy or the speci\\ufb01c \\nindustries in which they operate. Signi\\ufb01cant deteriorations of economic conditions, including signi\\ufb01cant in\\ufb02ation \\nover a prolonged period could produce a material adverse e\\ufb00ect on one or more of our signi\\ufb01cant operations. In \\naddition, our utilities and energy businesses and our railroad business regularly utilize debt as a component of their \\ncapital structures and depend on having access to borrowed funds through the capital markets at reasonable rates. \\nTo the extent that access to the capital markets is restricted or the cost of funding increases, these operations \\ncould be adversely a\\ufb00ected.\\nEpidemics, pandemics or other similar outbreaks could hurt our operating businesses. \\nThe outbreak of epidemics, pandemics or other similar outbreaks in the future may adversely a\\ufb00ect our \\noperations, including the value of our equity securities portfolio. This may be due to closures or restrictions \\nrequested or mandated by governmental authorities, disruption to supply chains and workforce, reduction of \\ndemand for our products and services, credit losses when customers and other counterparties fail to satisfy their \\nobligations to us, and volatility in global equity securities markets, among other factors. We share most of these \\nrisks with all businesses. \\nRegulatory changes may adversely impact our future operating results. \\nOver time, in response to \\ufb01nancial markets crises, global economic recessions, and social and environmental \\nissues, regulatory initiatives were adopted in the United States and elsewhere. Such initiatives addressed, for \\nexample, the regulation of banks and other major \\ufb01nancial institutions, the regulation of products and \\nenvironmental and global-warming matters. These initiatives impact all of our businesses, albeit in varying ways. \\nIncreased regulatory compliance costs could have a signi\\ufb01cant negative impact on our operating businesses, as \\nwell as on the businesses in which we have a signi\\ufb01cant, but not controlling economic interests. We cannot predict \\nwhether such initiatives will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated \\ufb01nancial position, results of \\noperations and/or cash \\ufb02ows. \\nData privacy regulations have recently been enacted in various jurisdictions in the U.S. and throughout the \\nworld. These regulations address numerous aspects related to the security of personal information that is stored in \\nour information systems, networks and facilities. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in \\nreputational damage and signi\\ufb01cant penalties.\\nClimate change and the regulation of greenhouse gas (\\u201cGHG\\u201d) emissions may impact our businesses. \\nThe impacts of climate change and the regulation of GHG emissions could impact our businesses to varying \\ndegrees. Climate change could cause or intensify hurricanes, \\ufb02oods, wild\\ufb01res, and other extreme weather events \\nthat may increase physical risks to and impacts on our operations. An increase in the frequency or intensity of \\nextreme weather events and storms could impact the physical assets of our non-insurance operations and could \\nproduce losses a\\ufb00ecting our businesses. Similarly, extreme weather events may produce losses a\\ufb00ecting our \\ninsurance operations as their primary business is to monitor, assess and price risk, including climate-related risk, at \\nan expected economic pro\\ufb01t to address the risk-transfer needs of their insurance customers. \\nAdditional GHG policies, including legislation, may emerge that accelerate the transition to a lower GHG \\nemitting economy and could, in turn, increase costs for our businesses to comply with those policies, including \\nBNSF and BHE, which combined represent more than 90% of Berkshire\\u2019s direct emissions. The failure to comply \\nwith new or existing regulations or reinterpretation of existing regulations relating to climate change could have a \\nsigni\\ufb01cant adverse e\\ufb00ect on our \\ufb01nancial results.\\nK-26 \\u00a0\\nRisks unique to our regulated businesses \\nOur tolerance for risk in our insurance businesses may result in signi\\ufb01cant underwriting losses. \\nWhen properly paid for the risk assumed, we have been and will continue to be willing to assume more risk \\nfrom a single event than any other insurer has knowingly assumed. Accordingly, we could incur a signi\\ufb01cant loss \\nfrom a single catastrophe event resulting from a natural disaster or man-made catastrophes such as terrorism or \\ncyber-attacks. We employ various disciplined underwriting practices intended to mitigate potential losses and \\nattempt to take into account all possible correlations and avoid writing groups of policies from which pre-tax losses \\nfrom a single catastrophe event might aggregate in excess of $15 billion. However, despite our e\\ufb00orts, it is possible \\nthat losses could manifest in ways that we do not anticipate and that our risk mitigation strategies are not designed \\nto address. Various provisions of our policies, negotiated to limit our risk, such as limitations or exclusions from \\ncoverage, may not be enforceable in the manner we intend, as it is possible that a court or regulatory authority \\ncould nullify or void an exclusion or limitation, or legislation could be enacted modifying or barring the use of these \\nexclusions and limitations. Our tolerance for signi\\ufb01cant insurance losses may result in lower reported earnings in a \\nfuture period. \\nThe principal cost associated with the property and casualty insurance business is claims. In writing property \\nand casualty insurance policies, we receive premiums today and promise to pay covered losses in the future. \\nHowever, it will take decades before all claims that have occurred as of any given balance sheet date will be \\nreported and settled. Although we believe that liabilities for unpaid losses are adequate, we will not know whether \\nthese liabilities or the premiums charged for the coverages provided were su\\ufb03cient until well after the balance \\nsheet date. Estimating insurance claim costs is inherently imprecise. It is possible that signi\\ufb01cant claims may \\nemerge or develop in the future from the policies we have written in the past. As industry practices and legal, social \\nand other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage \\nmay emerge, including new or expanded theories of liability. These or other changes could impose new \\ufb01nancial \\nobligations on us by extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent. In some instances, these changes may \\nnot become apparent until sometime after we have issued insurance or reinsurance contracts that are a\\ufb00ected by \\nthe changes. As a result, the full extent of liability under our insurance or reinsurance contracts may not be known \\nfor many years after a contract is issued. Our estimated unpaid losses arising under contracts covering property \\nand casualty insurance risks are large ($143 billion at December 31, 2022), and a small percentage increase to \\nthose liabilities can result in materially lower reported earnings. \\nChanges in regulations and regulatory actions can adversely a\\ufb00ect our operating results and our \\nability to allocate capital. \\nOur insurance businesses are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Such regulations \\nmay relate to among other things, the types of business that can be written, the rates that can be charged for \\ncoverage, the level of capital that must be maintained, and restrictions on the types and size of investments that \\ncan be made. Regulations may also restrict the timing and amount of dividend payments to Berkshire by these \\nbusinesses. U.S. state insurance regulators and international insurance regulators are also actively developing \\nvarious regulatory mechanisms to address the regulation of large internationally active insurance groups, including \\nregulations concerning group capital, liquidity, governance and risk management. Accordingly, changes in \\nregulations related to these or other matters or regulatory actions imposing restrictions on our insurance \\nbusinesses may adversely impact our results of operations and restrict our ability to allocate capital. \\nOur railroad business conducted through BNSF is also subject to a signi\\ufb01cant number of laws and regulations \\nwith respect to rates and practices, taxes, railroad operations and a variety of health, safety, labor, environmental \\nand other matters. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse e\\ufb00ect on \\nBNSF\\u2019s business. Governments may change the legislative and/or regulatory framework within which BNSF \\noperates, without providing any recourse for any adverse e\\ufb00ects that the change may have on the business. \\nComplying with legislative and regulatory changes may pose signi\\ufb01cant operating and implementation risks and \\nrequire signi\\ufb01cant capital expenditures. \\nBNSF derives signi\\ufb01cant amounts of revenue from the transportation of energy-related commodities, \\nparticularly coal. To the extent that changes in government policies limit or restrict the usage of coal as a source of \\nfuel in generating electricity or alternate fuels, such as natural gas, or displace coal on a competitive basis, \\nrevenues and earnings could be adversely a\\ufb00ected. As a common carrier, BNSF is also required to transport toxic \\ninhalation hazard chemicals and other hazardous materials. A release of hazardous materials could expose BNSF to \\nsigni\\ufb01cant claims, losses, penalties and environmental remediation obligations. Changes in the regulation of the rail \\nindustry could negatively impact BNSF\\u2019s ability to determine prices for rail services and to make capital \\nimprovements to its rail network, resulting in an adverse e\\ufb00ect on our results of operations, \\ufb01nancial condition \\nand/or liquidity. \\nK-27 \\u00a0\\nOur utilities and energy businesses operated under BHE are highly regulated by numerous federal, state, local \\nand foreign governmental authorities in the jurisdictions in which they operate. These laws and regulations are \\ncomplex, dynamic and subject to new interpretations or change. Regulations a\\ufb00ect almost every aspect of our \\nutilities and energy businesses. Regulations broadly apply and may limit management\\u2019s ability to independently \\nmake and implement decisions regarding numerous matters including: acquiring businesses; constructing, \\nacquiring, disposing or retiring of operating assets; operating and maintaining generating facilities and \\ntransmission and distribution system assets; complying with pipeline safety and integrity and environmental \\nrequirements; setting rates charged to customers; establishing capital structures and issuing debt; managing and \\nreporting transactions between our domestic utilities and our other subsidiaries and a\\ufb03liates; and paying dividends \\nor similar distributions. Failure to comply with or reinterpretations of existing regulations and new legislation or \\nregulations, such as those relating to air quality, climate change, emissions performance standards, water quality, \\ncoal ash disposal and other environmental matters, or changes in the nature of the regulatory process may have a \\nsigni\\ufb01cant adverse impact on our \\ufb01nancial results. \\nOur railroad business requires signi\\ufb01cant ongoing capital investment to improve and maintain its railroad \\nnetwork so that transportation services can be safely and reliably provided to customers on a timely basis. Our \\nutilities and energy businesses also require signi\\ufb01cant amounts of capital to construct, operate and maintain \\ngeneration, transmission and distribution systems to meet their customers\\u2019 needs and reliability criteria. System \\nassets may need to be operational for long periods of time in order to justify the \\ufb01nancial investment. The \\noperational or \\ufb01nancial failure of capital projects may not be recoverable through rates that are charged to \\ncustomers. Further, a signi\\ufb01cant portion of costs of capital improvements may be funded through debt issued by \\nBNSF and BHE and their subsidiaries. Disruptions in debt capital markets that restrict access to funding when \\nneeded could adversely a\\ufb00ect the results of operations, liquidity and/or capital resources of these businesses.\\nItem 1B.

Berkshire\\u2019s railroad and \\nutilities and energy businesses, in particular, utilize considerable physical assets in their businesses. \\nRailroad Business\\u2014Burlington Northern Santa Fe \\nThrough BNSF Railway, BNSF operates over 32,500 route miles of track (excluding multiple main tracks, yard \\ntracks and sidings) in 28 states, and also operates in three Canadian provinces. BNSF owns over 23,000 route \\nmiles, including easements, and operates over 9,000 route miles of trackage rights that permit BNSF to operate its \\ntrains with its crews over other railroads\\u2019 tracks. As of December 31, 2022, the total BNSF Railway system, \\nincluding single and multiple main tracks, yard tracks and sidings, consisted of over 50,000 operated miles of track. \\nBNSF operates various facilities and equipment to support its transportation system, including its \\ninfrastructure, locomotives and freight cars. It also owns or leases other equipment to support rail operations, such \\nas vehicles. Support facilities for rail operations include yards and terminals throughout its rail network, system \\nlocomotive shops to perform locomotive servicing and maintenance, a centralized network operations center for \\ntrain dispatching and network operations monitoring and management, computers, telecommunications \\nequipment, signal systems and other support systems. Transfer facilities are maintained for rail-to-rail as well as \\nintermodal transfer of containers, trailers and other freight tra\\ufb03c and include approximately 25 intermodal hubs \\nlocated across the system. BNSF owns or holds under non-cancelable leases exceeding one year approximately \\n7,500 locomotives and 68,000 freight cars, in addition to maintenance of way and other equipment. \\nIn the ordinary course of business, BNSF incurs signi\\ufb01cant costs in repairing and maintaining its properties. In \\n2022, BNSF recorded approximately $2 billion in repairs and maintenance expense. \\nK-28 \\u00a0\\nUtilities and Energy Businesses\\u2014Berkshire Hathaway Energy\\nBHE\\u2019s energy properties consist of the physical assets necessary to support its electricity and natural gas \\nbusinesses.

We manage our operating \\nbusinesses on an unusually decentralized basis. There are few centralized or integrated business functions. Our \\nsenior corporate management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for signi\\ufb01cant capital allocation \\ndecisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. \\nThe business segment data (Note 25 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in \\nconjunction with this discussion. \\nThe COVID-19 pandemic a\\ufb00ected our operating businesses in varying ways and degrees, particularly in 2020 \\nand 2021. Signi\\ufb01cant disruptions of supply chains and higher costs emerged in 2021 and persisted in 2022. Further, \\ngeopolitical con\\ufb02icts, including the Russia-Ukraine con\\ufb02ict, developed in 2022 and are continuing in 2023. We \\ncannot reliably predict future economic e\\ufb00ects of these events on our businesses. Nor can we reliably predict how \\nthese events will alter the future consumption patterns of consumers and businesses we serve. \\nInsurance underwriting generated an after-tax loss of $90 million in 2022 and after-tax earnings of $728 \\nmillion in 2021 and $657 million in 2020. Insurance underwriting results included after-tax losses from signi\\ufb01cant \\ncatastrophe events of approximately $2.4 billion in 2022, $2.3 billion in 2021 and $750 million in 2020. \\nUnderwriting results in 2022 were also negatively impacted by increases in private passenger automobile claims \\nfrequencies and severities at GEICO, and favorably impacted by higher earnings from reinsurance underwriting and \\nforeign currency exchange rate gains arising from the remeasurement of non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of \\nour U.S. insurance subsidiaries. \\nUnderwriting results in 2021 were favorably impacted by reductions in incurred losses for prior accident years \\nunder property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts. Underwriting results in 2021 were negatively \\nimpacted by higher private passenger auto claims frequencies and severities and by the reduction in earned \\npremium from the GEICO Giveback program, as well as from high claims costs in the life reinsurance business. \\nUnderwriting results in 2020 included the e\\ufb00ects of the pandemic, arising from premium reductions from the GEICO \\nGiveback program, signi\\ufb01cantly reduced claims frequencies for private passenger automobile insurance and \\nincreased loss estimates for certain commercial insurance coverages.\\nAfter-tax earnings from insurance investment income increased $1.7 billion in 2022 compared to 2021, \\nattributable to increased dividend income and higher interest rates. After-tax earnings from insurance investment \\nincome in 2021 and 2020 were negatively a\\ufb00ected by low interest rates on our substantial holdings of cash and \\nU.S. Treasury Bills. \\nK-33 \\u00a0\\nManagement\\u2019s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) \\nResults of Operations (Continued)\\nAfter-tax earnings of our railroad, BNSF were relatively unchanged in 2022 compared to 2021 and increased \\n16.1% in 2021 versus 2020. Results in 2022 re\\ufb02ected higher revenue per car/unit, substantially o\\ufb00set by lower \\noverall freight volumes and higher fuel and other operating costs. The earnings increase in 2021 re\\ufb02ected overall \\nhigher freight volumes, higher average revenue per car/unit and improved productivity, partly o\\ufb00set by higher \\naverage fuel prices and volume related costs. Earnings in 2020 re\\ufb02ected relatively low railroad operating revenues \\nfrom reduced shipping volumes, attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic, partly o\\ufb00set by lower operating costs and \\nthe e\\ufb00ects of productivity improvements. \\nAfter-tax earnings of our utilities and energy business increased 9.3% in 2022 compared to 2021 and 13.7% in \\n2021 versus 2020. The increase in 2022 re\\ufb02ected higher earnings from other energy businesses, including tax \\nequity investments and the Northern Powergrid businesses, as well as from the natural gas pipeline businesses, \\npartly o\\ufb00set by lower earnings from the real estate brokerage business. The increase in 2021 re\\ufb02ected higher \\nearnings from the U.S. utilities and natural gas pipelines businesses. \\nEarnings from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses increased 12.5% in 2022 compared to 2021 \\nand 34.0% in 2021 versus 2020. Operating results in 2022 were mixed among our various businesses. While \\ncustomer demand for products and services was relatively good in 2022, demand began to weaken in the second \\nhalf of the year at certain of our businesses. We experienced the negative e\\ufb00ects of higher materials, freight, labor \\nand other input costs through much of 2022. Many of our businesses generated signi\\ufb01cantly higher earnings in \\n2021 compared to 2020, attributable to relatively strong customer demand for products and higher selling prices, \\npartially o\\ufb00set by higher materials, freight and other input costs attributable to ongoing disruptions in global supply \\nchains. \\nInvestment and derivative contract gains (losses) in each of the three years presented predominantly derived \\nfrom our investments in equity securities and included signi\\ufb01cant net unrealized gains and losses from market price \\nchanges. We believe that investment gains and losses on investments in equity securities, whether realized from \\ndispositions or unrealized from changes in market prices, are generally meaningless in understanding our reported \\nquarterly or annual results or evaluating the economic performance of our operating businesses. These gains and \\nlosses have caused and will continue to cause signi\\ufb01cant volatility in our periodic earnings.\\nOther earnings included after-tax foreign exchange rate gains of approximately $1.3 billion in 2022 and $1.0 \\nbillion in 2021 and after-tax losses of $764 million in 2020 related to the non-U.S. Dollar denominated debt issued \\nby Berkshire and its U.S.-based \\ufb01nance subsidiary, Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation (\\u201cBHFC\\u201d). Other \\nearnings also included after-tax goodwill and inde\\ufb01nite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $157 million in \\n2022, $259 million in 2021 and $11.0 billion in 2020. Such amounts included our share of impairment charges \\nrecorded by Kraft Heinz. Approximately $9.8 billion of the charges in 2020 were attributable to impairments of \\ngoodwill and inde\\ufb01nite-lived intangible assets recorded in connection with Berkshire\\u2019s acquisition of Precision \\nCastparts in 2016. \\nInsurance\\u2014Underwriting \\nOur management views our insurance businesses as possessing two distinct activities \\u2013 underwriting and \\ninvesting. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers, while investing decisions are the \\nresponsibility of Berkshire\\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Bu\\ufb00ett and Berkshire\\u2019s corporate investment managers. \\nAccordingly, we evaluate performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income or \\ninvestment gains and losses. We consider investment income as an integral component of our aggregate insurance \\noperating results. However, we consider investment gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized, as non-\\noperating. We believe that such gains and losses are not meaningful in understanding the periodic operating results \\nof our insurance businesses. \\nThe timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses can produce signi\\ufb01cant volatility in our periodic underwriting \\nresults, particularly with respect to our reinsurance businesses. We currently consider pre-tax incurred losses \\nexceeding $150 million from a current year catastrophic event to be signi\\ufb01cant. Signi\\ufb01cant catastrophe events in \\n2022 included Hurricane Ian and \\ufb02oods in Australia, while signi\\ufb01cant events in 2021 included Hurricane Ida, \\ufb02oods \\nin Europe and Winter Storm Uri.\\nChanges in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for \\noccurrences in prior years, can also signi\\ufb01cantly a\\ufb00ect our periodic underwriting results. Unpaid loss estimates, \\nincluding estimates under retroactive reinsurance contracts, were approximately $143 billion as of December 31, \\n2022 and $125 billion as of December 31, 2021. Our periodic underwriting results may also include signi\\ufb01cant \\nforeign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the changes in the valuation of non-U.S. Dollar \\ndenominated liabilities of our U.S. based insurance subsidiaries due to foreign currency exchange rate \\ufb02uctuations. \\nK-34 \\u00a0\\nManagement\\u2019s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) \\nInsurance\\u2014Underwriting (Continued) \\nWe provide primary insurance and reinsurance products covering property and casualty risks, as well as life \\nand health risks. Our insurance and reinsurance businesses are GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (\\u201cBH \\nPrimary\\u201d) and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (\\u201cBHRG\\u201d). On October 19, 2022, Berkshire acquired \\nAlleghany Corporation (\\u201cAlleghany\\u201d), which operates property and casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses. \\nThese businesses were included in the BH Primary and BHRG underwriting results beginning as of that date. \\nWe strive to produce pre-tax underwriting earnings (premiums earned less losses incurred and underwriting \\nexpenses) over the long term in all business categories, except for BHRG\\u2019s retroactive reinsurance and periodic \\npayment annuity contracts. Time-value-of-money is an important element in establishing prices for these contracts. \\nWe normally receive all premiums at the contract inception date, which are immediately available for investment. \\nUltimate claim payments can extend for decades and are expected to exceed premiums, producing underwriting \\nlosses over the claim settlement periods, primarily through deferred charge amortization and discount accretion \\ncharges.\\nUnderwriting results of our insurance businesses are summarized below (dollars in millions). \\n\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0 2022 \\u00a0\\u00a0 2021 \\u00a0\\u00a0 2020 \\u00a0\\nPre-tax underwriting earnings (loss): \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u00a0\\u00a0\\nGEICO $ (1,880)\\u00a0$ 1,259\\u00a0\\u00a0$ 3,428\\u00a0\\nBerkshire Hathaway Primary Group \\u00a0 393\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 607\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 110\\u00a0\\nBerkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group \\u00a0 1,389\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 (930)\\u00a0\\u00a0 (2,700)\\nPre-tax underwriting earnings \\u00a0 (98)\\u00a0\\u00a0 936\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 838\\u00a0\\nIncome taxes and noncontrolling interests \\u00a0 (8)\\u00a0\\u00a0 208\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 181\\u00a0\\nNet underwriting earnings (loss) $ (90)\\u00a0$ 728\\u00a0\\u00a0$ 657\\u00a0\\nE\\ufb00ective income tax rate \\u00a0 8.5%\\u00a0\\u00a0 22.2%\\u00a0\\u00a0 21.5%\\n\\u00a0\\nGEICO \\nGEICO writes private passenger automobile insurance, o\\ufb00ering coverages to insureds in all 50 states and the \\nDistrict of Columbia.

Premiums earned increased $1.3 billion (3.4%) in 2022 compared to 2021, partially \\nattributable to a reduction in 2021 of approximately $475 million from the remaining impact of the GEICO Giveback \\nprogram. \\nLosses and loss adjustment expenses increased $5.3 billion (17.1%) in 2022 compared to 2021. GEICO\\u2019s ratio \\nof losses and loss adjustment expenses to premiums earned (the \\u201closs ratio\\u201d) was 93.1% in 2022, an increase of \\n10.9 percentage points over 2021. The increase was primarily attributable to higher claims frequencies and \\nseverities, as well as lower reductions of ultimate loss estimates for prior years\\u2019 events.\\nClaims frequencies in 2022 were higher for all coverages, including property damage (one to two percent \\nrange), bodily injury and collision (four to \\ufb01ve percent range) and personal injury (three to four percent range). \\nAverage claims severities in 2022 were higher for all coverages, including property damage (twenty-one to twenty-\\ntwo percent range), collision (fourteen to sixteen percent range) and bodily injury (nine to eleven percent range). \\nLosses and loss adjustment expenses re\\ufb02ected reductions in the ultimate loss estimates for prior years\\u2019 loss events \\nof $653 million in 2022 compared to $1.8 billion in 2021. The reductions in 2022 re\\ufb02ected decreases in all major \\ncoverages except collision and property damage coverages, while the reductions in 2021 were across all major \\ncoverages. Losses and loss adjustment expenses were approximately $400 million from Hurricane Ian in 2022 and \\n$375 million from Hurricane Ida in 2021. \\nUnderwriting expenses decreased $881 million (16.2%) in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to signi\\ufb01cant \\nreductions in advertising costs and lower employee-related costs. GEICO\\u2019s expense ratio (underwriting expense to \\npremiums earned) was 11.7% in 2022, a decrease of 2.8 percentage points compared to 2021, attributable to both \\nthe decrease in expenses as well as the increase in earned premiums.\\nGEICO has successfully obtained premium rate increase approvals from certain states in response to the \\nsigni\\ufb01cant claims costs increases it has experienced in recent years. As a result, we currently expect GEICO to \\ngenerate an underwriting pro\\ufb01t in 2023.\\n2021 versus 2020\\nPremiums written in 2021 increased $3.5 billion (9.9%) compared to 2020, which included a reduction of \\napproximately $2.9 billion attributable to the GEICO Giveback program.

GEICO\\u2019s loss ratio \\nincreased 8.1 percentage points compared to 2020. The increase in the loss ratio re\\ufb02ected an increase in average \\nclaims frequencies and severities and higher losses from signi\\ufb01cant catastrophe events, partially o\\ufb00set by \\nincreased reductions of ultimate estimated losses for claims occurring in prior years. \\nClaims frequencies in 2021 were higher for all coverages, including property damage and bodily injury \\n(thirteen to fourteen percent range), personal injury (sixteen to seventeen percent range) and collision (twenty-one \\nto twenty-two percent range). Average claims severities in 2021 were also higher for property damage coverage \\n(two to three percent range), collision coverage (\\ufb01fteen to sixteen percent range) and bodily injury coverage (eight \\nto ten percent range). Ultimate claim loss estimates for claims occurring in prior years were reduced approximately \\n$1.8 billion in 2021 and $253 million in 2020.

Retail \\ncustomer volumes increased 2.4% (1.6% at Paci\\ufb01Corp, 4.3% at MEC and 2.2% at NV Energy) in 2022 compared to \\n2021, primarily due to higher customer usage, an increase in the average number of customers and the favorable \\nimpact of weather.\\nNatural gas pipelines\\u2019 after-tax earnings increased $233 million in 2022 compared to 2021. Substantially all of \\nthe increase was derived from BHE GT&S, primarily attributable to higher regulated storage and service revenues \\nfrom a general rate case settlement and higher revenues and margins from non-regulated activities, as well as \\nincome tax adjustments.\\nOther energy businesses\\u2019 after-tax earnings increased $359 million in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase \\nwas primarily due to increased wind tax equity investment earnings of $200 million and the impact in 2021 on \\nincome tax expense of $109 million at Northern Powergrid related to the enactment in June 2021 of an increase in \\nthe United Kingdom corporate income tax rate from 19% to 25%, e\\ufb00ective April 1, 2023.

The increase in wind tax equity investment earnings re\\ufb02ected the impact of \\nlosses in 2021 on pre-existing tax equity investments due to the February 2021 winter storms as well as increased \\nincome tax bene\\ufb01ts from projects reaching commercial operation over the past twelve months.\\nReal estate brokerage after-tax earnings decreased $287 million in 2022 compared to 2021. The decrease \\nre\\ufb02ected lower brokerage services revenues and margins, primarily due to an 11% reduction in closed brokerage \\ntransaction volumes, as well as lower mortgage services revenues and margins from a 40% decrease in closed \\ntransaction volumes, attributable to lower homeowner re\\ufb01nancing activity resulting from rising interest rates.\\nCorporate interest and other after-tax earnings decreased $84 million in 2022 compared to 2021.

PCC derives \\nsigni\\ufb01cant revenues and earnings from aerospace products. The revenue increase in 2022 was primarily \\nattributable to higher demand for aerospace products. Commercial aircraft delivery rates by original equipment \\nmanufacturers (\\u201cOEMs\\u201d) of narrow-body aircraft have rebounded since the onset of the pandemic. Deliveries of \\nwide-body aircraft remain relatively low, in part, attributable to the pause in the Boeing 787 program. However, \\nBoeing resumed deliveries in the third quarter of 2022. Long-term industry forecasts continue to show growth and \\nstrong demand for air travel and aerospace products. \\nPCC\\u2019s pre-tax earnings in 2022 were $1.2 billion, an increase of 1.6% compared to 2021. PCC\\u2019s results in 2022 \\nwere negatively a\\ufb00ected by increased costs for labor and training, materials and utilities and supply chain \\ndisruptions, as well as a $59 million reduction in pension plan income. PCC management has taken and will \\ncontinue to take actions to improve operations, maintain safety and prepare for increased demand for its products. \\nGrowth in PCC\\u2019s revenues and earnings will be predicated on the ability to successfully increase production levels to \\nmatch the expected growth in aerospace demand, including managing through the current supply chain and \\nemployment environments.\\nLubrizol\\u2019s revenues were $6.7 billion in 2022, an increase of 3.2% compared to 2021. The revenue increase \\nre\\ufb02ected higher average selling prices, partially o\\ufb00set by lower volumes and adverse foreign currency translation \\ne\\ufb00ects from the stronger U.S. Dollar. Sales volumes throughout 2022 were restricted by e\\ufb00ects of supply \\nconstraints for certain raw materials and the e\\ufb00ects of unplanned plant maintenance activities, both of which \\nlimited Lubrizol\\u2019s production capabilities. The increase in average selling prices was driven by escalating prices for \\nraw materials, including oil feedstocks, as well as for utilities, packaging, shipping and freight costs. We believe \\nsupply chain and required maintenance constraints are easing and that we can increase production rates and sales \\nvolumes in 2023. \\nLubrizol\\u2019s pre-tax earnings in 2022 increased 48.6% compared to 2021. Pre-tax earnings in 2022 included \\ninsurance recoveries of $242 million related to a \\ufb01re in 2019 at the Rouen, France facility and a \\ufb01re in 2021 at the \\nRockton, Illinois, facility compared to insurance recoveries of $55 million in 2021.

Earnings in 2022 were also negatively impacted by rising raw material costs, \\nlower sales volumes, higher unplanned maintenance expenses, and by unfavorable foreign currency translation \\ne\\ufb00ects, partially o\\ufb00set by higher selling prices. Earnings in 2021 were negatively impacted by severe winter storms, \\nwhich caused industry-wide temporary facilities closures, including at our Additives facilities, which experienced \\nlost sales and incremental manufacturing and other operating costs.\\nMarmon\\u2019s revenues were $10.7 billion in 2022, an increase of $934 million (9.6%) compared to 2021. Nearly \\nall of Marmon\\u2019s business groups generated higher revenues in 2022, led by signi\\ufb01cant increases in the \\nTransportation, Retail Solutions, Metal Services and Crane groups, which contributed 82% of the increase. These \\nincreases generally re\\ufb02ected higher volumes and prices in our heavy-duty truck & trailer, shopping cart and store \\nshelving businesses, stronger demand in Canada for metal services and higher demand in the mining and \\ninfrastructure markets. Revenues of most of Marmon\\u2019s other groups, particularly those serving the transit, oil & gas, \\nutility and restaurant markets, also increased in 2022, re\\ufb02ecting higher volumes. These increases were partially \\no\\ufb00set by lower lease revenues in the Rail & Leasing group, re\\ufb02ecting lower renewal rates and fewer third-party tank \\ncar sales.\\nK-48 \\u00a0\\nManagement\\u2019s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) \\nManufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) \\nIndustrial products (Continued)\\nMarmon\\u2019s pre-tax earnings in 2022 increased 11.3% compared to 2021. Earnings in 2022 re\\ufb02ected increases \\nin the Transportation, Metal Services, Retail, Crane and several other business groups due to higher volumes and \\npricing, which were partially o\\ufb00set by lower earnings from the Rail & Leasing group, re\\ufb02ecting lower renewal rates, \\nhigher repair costs and losses of approximately $90 million related to the shutdown in the second quarter of its \\nbusiness in Russia. \\nIMC\\u2019s revenues increased 4.5% to $3.7 billion in 2022 compared to 2021, re\\ufb02ecting increased sales in most \\nregions, partially o\\ufb00set by the foreign currency translation e\\ufb00ects of a stronger U.S. Dollar, lower sales in China \\n(attributable to the pandemic) and the e\\ufb00ects the Russia-Ukraine con\\ufb02ict in Europe. IMC\\u2019s pre-tax earnings \\ndecreased 2.5% in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to lower average gross sales margins, primarily \\nattributable to changes in product sales mix and higher raw material costs.

The COVID-\\n19 pandemic contributed to material declines in commercial air travel and OEM aircraft production in 2021 and \\n2020. PCC\\u2019s revenues were negatively impacted in both years by reduced aircraft production levels, which re\\ufb02ected \\norder delays and cancellations by airlines and inventory reduction initiatives within the industry.\\nPCC\\u2019s pre-tax earnings in 2021 were $1.2 billion, an increase of 78.8% compared to 2020, which re\\ufb02ected \\nsigni\\ufb01cant restructuring costs and ine\\ufb03ciencies associated with reduction in production. Asset impairment and \\nrestructuring costs in 2020 were $295 million. The 2021 earnings increase also re\\ufb02ected the actions taken by \\nmanagement in 2020 and 2021 to resize, restructure and improve operations and to prepare for more normalized \\ndemand, as well as from a decline in restructuring costs.\\nLubrizol\\u2019s revenues were $6.5 billion in 2021, an increase of 8.6% compared to 2020. The increase re\\ufb02ects \\nhigher average selling prices, driven by signi\\ufb01cant increases in materials and other manufacturing costs, as well as \\nslightly higher volumes. Sales volumes in the Additives product lines in 2021 were negatively a\\ufb00ected by the \\nimpacts of the severe winter weather events in the \\ufb01rst quarter, raw materials supply constraints and unplanned \\nmaintenance in the second half of the year.\\nLubrizol\\u2019s pre-tax earnings in 2021 decreased 50.8% compared to 2020. The earnings decline in 2021 included \\npreviously mentioned losses of $257 million related to the Rockton, Illinois facility \\ufb01re and asset impairment \\ncharges, as well as the adverse e\\ufb00ects of rising raw material costs and the winter storms in 2021.\\nMarmon\\u2019s revenues were $9.8 billion in 2021, an increase of $2.1 billion (27.9%) compared to 2020, which \\nwas negatively impacted by the initial e\\ufb00ects of the pandemic. Revenues in 2021 from the Electrical, Metal Services \\nand Plumbing & Refrigeration groups increased 54% over 2020, accounting for over half of the aggregate increase \\nin Marmon\\u2019s revenues. These increases were attributable to higher volumes and prices, including the impact of \\nsigni\\ufb01cantly higher average copper and metal prices. Revenues of most of Marmon\\u2019s other groups, particularly \\nthose serving the construction, automotive, heavy-duty truck and restaurant markets, also increased in 2021, \\nre\\ufb02ecting higher volumes. These increases were partially o\\ufb00set by the impact of divestitures and business closures \\nin the Water Technologies and Retail Solutions groups and lower lease revenues in the Rail & Leasing group, \\nre\\ufb02ecting fewer railcars on lease and changes in lease mix. \\nK-49 \\u00a0\\nManagement\\u2019s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) \\nManufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) \\nIndustrial products (Continued)\\nMarmon\\u2019s pre-tax earnings increased 40.3% in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to \\nearnings increases in the Electrical, Metal Services and Plumbing & Refrigeration groups due to higher volumes and \\naverage margins and relatively low earnings in 2020 attributable to the pandemic. Earnings of several other \\nbusiness groups also increased attributable to higher sales volumes, sales mix changes and lower restructuring \\ncharges, which were partially o\\ufb00set by lower earnings from the Rail & Leasing and Water Technologies groups. \\nIMC\\u2019s revenues increased 19.5% in 2021 compared to 2020, re\\ufb02ecting improving business conditions in most \\ngeographic regions and favorable foreign currency translation e\\ufb00ects.

Pre-tax earnings as percentages of revenues were 16.6% in 2022 \\nand 13.6% in 2021. During 2021 and much of 2022, our businesses experienced relatively strong customer demand \\nand higher sales volumes. Our building products businesses bene\\ufb01ted in recent years from the low interest rate \\nenvironment. However, interest rates in the U.S. increased signi\\ufb01cantly during 2022, which contributed to slowing \\ndemand for new home construction in the fourth quarter. As such, comparative revenues and earnings in the near \\nterm will likely decline from current levels.\\nClayton Homes\\u2019 revenues were approximately $12.7 billion in 2022, an increase of $2.2 billion (21.1%) over \\n2021. Revenues from home sales for the year increased $2.1 billion (25.1%) in 2022 to approximately $10.4 billion, \\nprimarily due to higher average selling prices. New home unit sales increased 6.2% in 2022, re\\ufb02ecting a 6.0% \\nincrease in factory-built manufactured home unit sales and a 7.1% increase in site-built home unit sales. However, \\nunit sales in the fourth quarter of 2022 declined 3.9% from 2021, and our net order backlog declined signi\\ufb01cantly \\nduring 2022. We expect the comparative decline in unit sales to accelerate in the near term. Financial services \\nrevenues, which include mortgage, insurance and interest income from lending activities, increased 4.7% in 2022 \\ncompared to 2021. Loan balances, net of allowances for credit losses, were approximately $21.3 billion as of \\nDecember 31, 2022, an increase of approximately $2.5 billion from December 31, 2021. Actual and anticipated loan \\nforeclosures rose during the fourth quarter of 2022.\\nPre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes were approximately $2.4 billion in 2022, an increase of $685 million \\n(40.7%) compared to 2021. Earnings in 2022 re\\ufb02ected higher home sales, gross margin rates and net interest \\nincome. As previously mentioned, we expect unit home sales to decline in the near term and we anticipate earnings \\nwill also decline in 2023 compared to 2022.\\nAggregate revenues of our other building products businesses were approximately $16.2 billion in 2022, an \\nincrease of 11.8% versus 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher average selling prices, and to a lesser \\nextent, from higher unit volumes in certain product lines and product mix changes. Signi\\ufb01cant cost in\\ufb02ation in \\n2021, that continued through 2022, largely drove the higher selling prices.\\nPre-tax earnings of the other building products businesses were approximately $2.4 billion in 2022, an \\nincrease of 41.9% over 2021. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues was 15.0% in 2022, a 3.2 percentage \\npoint increase compared to 2021. Earnings in 2022 bene\\ufb01tted from higher selling prices and strong demand in \\ncertain product categories, as well as an increase in gains from certain business divestitures and asset sales and \\nreduced impairment and restructuring charges. The increase in earnings in 2022 also re\\ufb02ected the negative impact \\nof severe winter storms in the \\ufb01rst quarter of 2021, which reduced sales and increased production and other \\noperating costs in 2021.\\nK-50 \\u00a0\\nManagement\\u2019s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) \\nManufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) \\nBuilding products (Continued)\\n2021 versus 2020\\nRevenues of the building products group increased $3.7 billion (17.6%) in 2021 and pre-tax earnings \\nincreased $532 million (18.6%) compared to 2020. Pre-tax earnings as percentages of revenues were 13.6% in \\n2021 and 13.5% in 2020. During 2021, our businesses experienced strong customer demand and higher sales \\nvolumes. We also experienced various forms of supply chain disruptions that contributed to considerable raw \\nmaterial and logistics cost in\\ufb02ation and supply constraints.\\nClayton Homes\\u2019 revenues were approximately $10.5 billion in 2021, an increase of $1.9 billion (22.2%) over \\n2020.

Unit sales of site-built \\nhomes increased 15.8% in 2021, while factory-built manufactured home unit sales increased 1.5%. Site-built home \\nunit sales were constrained by longer construction periods arising from supply chain constraints and labor \\nshortages. Financial services revenues increased 7.8% in 2021 compared to 2020.

Earnings in 2021 re\\ufb02ected higher earnings from home sales, mortgage originations, net \\ninterest income and lower provisions for expected credit losses, partially o\\ufb00set by the impact of rising \\nmanufacturing and supply chain costs. The provision for expected credit losses in 2020 was unusually high and \\nincluded provisions for the expected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. \\nAggregate revenues of our other building products businesses were approximately $14.5 billion in 2021, an \\nincrease of 14.4% versus 2020. The increase was primarily due to higher average selling prices driven by \\nsigni\\ufb01cantly higher input and supply chain costs, as well as higher unit volumes for paint and coatings, \\ufb02ooring, \\ninsulation, roo\\ufb01ng and other engineered products.\\nPre-tax earnings of the other building products businesses were approximately $1.7 billion in 2021, an \\nincrease of 5.7% over 2020. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues were 11.8% in 2021, a 1.0 percentage \\npoint decrease compared to 2020. While customer demand in 2021 was generally strong, reduced availability of \\nmaterials and other product inputs from supply chain disruptions negatively a\\ufb00ected operating results. In addition, \\nhigher restructuring and impairment charges contributed to the reduction in our pre-tax margin rates.\\nConsumer products \\nThe consumer products group includes leisure vehicles (Forest River), several apparel and footwear operations \\n(including Fruit of the Loom, Garan, H.H.

In the fourth quarter of 2022, consumer products \\nrevenues before the impact of the Jazwares acquisition declined 15.7%, driven by signi\\ufb01cant declines in \\nrecreational vehicle unit sales. Revenues of Forest River increased 8.0% in 2022 compared to 2021, while apparel \\nand footwear and Duracell revenues decreased 4.5% and 5.2%, respectively. The declines in apparel and footwear \\nrevenues were driven by lower volumes, as major retailers reduced orders in response to rising inventories. \\nDuracell\\u2019s revenue decline was primarily due to lower volumes and unfavorable foreign currency translation e\\ufb00ects \\nof the stronger U.S. Dollar. \\nK-51 \\u00a0\\nManagement\\u2019s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) \\nManufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued) \\nConsumer products (Continued)\\nConsumer products group pre-tax earnings declined $456 million (23.0%) in 2022 compared to 2021 and as a \\npercentage of revenues in 2022 decreased 3.2 percentage points to 9.5%. The earnings decline re\\ufb02ected lower \\naggregate earnings from the apparel and footwear businesses (68.0%) and Duracell (30.6%), partially o\\ufb00set by \\nhigher earnings from Forest River (7.6%).\\nOur apparel businesses were negatively a\\ufb00ected in 2022 by low sales volumes, reduced manufacturing \\ne\\ufb03ciencies and higher input costs, including raw materials, freight, labor and other operating costs. The reductions \\nin sales volumes and supply chain issues in 2021 and 2022 have also elevated our current inventories. We currently \\nbelieve retailers will continue to constrain purchases in the near term and that our sales volumes and earnings will \\ncontinue to be negatively a\\ufb00ected. We are taking measures to right-size our operations for the long-term and \\nreduce product inventories to more appropriate levels. Duracell\\u2019s earnings in 2022 declined, primarily due to lower \\nsales, cost in\\ufb02ation and foreign currency translation e\\ufb00ects. \\nEarnings from Forest River increased in 2022, primarily due to the increase in unit sales in the \\ufb01rst half of the \\nyear and higher average selling prices, partly o\\ufb00set by higher materials costs. However, sales volumes, revenues \\nand earnings declined over the second half of the year compared to the elevated levels in the \\ufb01rst half of 2022 and \\nin 2021. We currently expect demand for recreational vehicles will continue to slow and Forest River\\u2019s comparative \\nrevenues and earnings to decline in 2023, particularly over the \\ufb01rst half of the year. \\n2021 versus 2020\\nConsumer products group revenues increased $3.4 billion (28.0%) in 2021 versus 2020. Revenues from Forest \\nRiver increased 40.2% in 2021 compared to 2020, driven by a 27.6% increase in recreational vehicle unit sales and \\nhigher average selling prices, primarily due to signi\\ufb01cant increases in manufacturing costs. \\nRevenues of several of our other consumer products businesses were signi\\ufb01cantly higher in 2021 as compared \\nto 2020. The initial impacts of the pandemic in the \\ufb01rst half of 2020 from temporary retail store closures and \\nreduced demand had a severe impact on most of these businesses.

Our other \\nservice businesses franchise and service a network of quick service restaurants (Dairy Queen), lease transportation \\nequipment (XTRA) and furniture (CORT), provide third party logistics services that primarily serve the petroleum \\nand chemical industries (Charter Brokerage), distribute electronic news, multimedia and regulatory \\ufb01lings (Business \\nWire) and operate a television station in Miami, Florida (WPLG). Beginning, October 19, 2022, this group includes \\nIPS Integrated Project Services, LLC (IPS), a provider of various services in facilities construction management.\\n2022 versus 2021\\nService group revenues increased $3.1 billion (19.7%) in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily attributable to \\nrevenue increases from TTI and the aviation services businesses, as well as the impact of the IPS acquisition. \\nRevenues from TTI increased 17.4% in 2022 versus 2021. However, in the third quarter, new orders began to slow \\nin certain regions and markets and the slowing of new orders was observed across nearly all regions in the fourth \\nquarter. The slowing of electronic components demand is in part attributable to elevated inventory levels within the \\nsupply chain. Revenues from aviation services increased 18.2% in 2022 compared to 2021. The revenue increase \\nre\\ufb02ected year-to-date increases in training hours (11%), customer \\ufb02ight hours (9%), most of which occurred in the \\n\\ufb01rst half of the year, and fuel surcharges to customers due to the increase in customer \\ufb02ight hours and signi\\ufb01cant \\nincreases in fuel prices. These increases were partially o\\ufb00set by changes in sales mix. \\nPre-tax earnings of our service business group increased $375 million (14.0%) in 2022 to $3.0 billion. Pre-tax \\nearnings of the group as a percentage of revenues were 16.0% in 2022, a decrease of 0.8 percentage points \\ncompared to 2021. The earnings increase in 2022 was attributable to TTI (19.4%) and aviation services (3.4%), as \\nwell as increased earnings from several of our smaller services businesses. The increase from TTI was primarily \\nattributable to the increase in sales and higher average gross margin rates, partially o\\ufb00set by unfavorable foreign \\ncurrency e\\ufb00ects in 2022 and a favorable legal settlement in 2021. The earnings increase from aviation services in \\n2022 compared to 2021 was primarily attributable to improved product sales margins, increased training hours and \\nlower restructuring costs at FlightSafety. Earnings at our smaller services companies increased $106 million (19.3%) \\nover 2021, re\\ufb02ecting a combination of higher revenues and operating cost leverage. \\n2021 versus 2020\\nService group revenues increased $3.5 billion (28.6%) in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily attributable to \\nhigher revenues from TTI and the aviation services businesses. Revenues from TTI increased 37.4% in 2021 versus \\n2020, primarily attributable to signi\\ufb01cantly higher volumes across all signi\\ufb01cant markets and product categories, \\nand to a lesser extent, higher average prices and changes in sales mix. Customer demand accelerated throughout \\n2021, as customers attempted to maintain adequate inventories in response to high demand for components in \\nend products and e\\ufb00ects of supply chain disruptions. Revenues from aviation services increased 27.5% in 2021 \\nover low 2020 levels, primarily due to higher training hours (24%) and customer \\ufb02ight hours (70%).\\nPre-tax earnings of our service business group increased $1.1 billion (67.0%) to $2.7 billion. Pre-tax earnings \\nof the group as a percentage of revenues was 16.8% in 2021, an increase of 3.8 percentage points compared to \\n2020. Earnings at nearly all service businesses increased in 2021 compared to 2020, with the largest increases \\nfrom TTI, the aviation services businesses and the XTRA leasing business. TTI\\u2019s earnings increase was primarily \\nattributable to increases in sales volumes, as well as from improved operating cost leverage, changes in sales mix \\nand a gain from a legal settlement. The increase in earnings from aviation services was attributable to the \\nfavorable e\\ufb00ects of higher volume, changes in business mix, increased operating e\\ufb03ciencies, lower impairment \\ncharges and the e\\ufb00ects of past restructuring e\\ufb00orts, partly o\\ufb00set by higher subcontractor costs attributable to the \\nsigni\\ufb01cant increase in \\ufb02ight demand. \\nRetailing \\nOur largest retailing business is Berkshire Hathaway Automotive, Inc. (\\u201cBHA\\u201d), which represented 65% of our \\ncombined retailing revenue in 2022. BHA consists of over 80 auto dealerships that sell new and pre-owned \\nautomobiles and o\\ufb00er repair services and related products. BHA also operates two insurance businesses, two auto \\nauctions and an automotive \\ufb02uid maintenance products distributor. Our retailing businesses also include four home \\nfurnishings businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C.

BHA\\u2019s revenues in 2022 increased 6.1% \\ncompared to 2021. Revenues from new and used retail vehicle sales increased 5.9% compared to 2021, attributable \\nto higher average vehicle transaction prices, partly o\\ufb00set by a 4.5% decline in total retail units sold. New vehicle \\nunit sales continue to be constrained by relatively low new vehicle production, although production gradually \\ntrended higher during 2022. Revenues from BHA\\u2019s service and repair business increased 11.1% versus 2021. \\nRevenues of the home furnishings group declined 2.6%, while revenues of all other retailers declined 8.9%, \\nprimarily due to lower sales at Pampered Chef. \\nPre-tax earnings in 2022 of the retailing group decreased $85 million (4.7%) from 2021 and the pre-tax margin \\nrate decreased 0.6 percentage points to 8.9%. BHA\\u2019s pre-tax earnings increased 18.4%, primarily due to increases \\nin vehicle gross pro\\ufb01t margins. BHA\\u2019s comparative vehicle gross pro\\ufb01t margin rates began to accelerate during the \\nsecond half of 2021, attributable to low available inventory. BHA\\u2019s vehicle gross margin rates peaked in the \\ufb01rst half \\nof 2022 and have since declined. Aggregate pre-tax earnings for the remainder of our retailing group decreased \\n$233 million (23.2%) in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to reduced earnings from the home furnishings \\ngroup, See\\u2019s Candies and Pampered Chef.\\n2021 versus 2020\\nRetailing group revenues in 2021 increased $3.1 billion (19.8%) compared to 2020.

Revenues from vehicle sales increased $1.7 billion (20.7%), primarily due to higher average selling prices, as \\nwell as a 2.7% increase in units sold. However, new vehicle unit sales in the second half of 2021 declined 18% \\ncompared to the second half of 2020, re\\ufb02ecting signi\\ufb01cant new vehicle supply shortages at manufacturers \\nattributable to the global computer chip shortages and other supply chain disruptions. Home furnishings group \\nrevenues increased 22.0%, attributable to higher consumer demand and higher average selling prices, driven by \\nhigher inventory and freight costs. \\nPre-tax earnings of the retailing group increased $781 million (76.0%) in 2021 from 2020 and the pre-tax \\nmargin rate increased 3.0 percentage points to 9.5%. BHA\\u2019s pre-tax earnings increased 47.5%, primarily due to \\nincreased vehicle sales margins and higher earnings from \\ufb01nance and service contract activities. In addition, \\nearnings in 2021 bene\\ufb01tted from lower \\ufb02oorplan interest expense, attributable to signi\\ufb01cant declines in inventory \\nlevels, and from ongoing operating cost control e\\ufb00orts. \\nHome furnishings group pre-tax earnings increased 67.6% in 2021 versus 2020, re\\ufb02ecting generally higher \\naverage gross margin rates and sales mix changes and cost control e\\ufb00orts, partly o\\ufb00set by higher personnel costs. \\nAggregate pre-tax earnings for the remainder of our retailing group increased $321 million in 2021 compared to \\n2020. The initial e\\ufb00ects of the pandemic in 2020 were severe for most of our other retailers due to the restricted \\noperations at many of those businesses.

The increase re\\ufb02ected slightly \\nhigher gross margin rates in the grocery and foodservice businesses, partly o\\ufb00set by higher personnel costs, fuel \\nexpense and insurance costs.

Revenues from the grocery business \\nincreased 1.5%, while revenues from the foodservice and beverage businesses increased 13.1% and 17.8%, \\nrespectively. The foodservice business was signi\\ufb01cantly impacted by pandemic-related restaurant closures in 2020.\\nPre-tax earnings decreased $21 million (8.4%) in 2021 as compared to 2020. The decrease re\\ufb02ected \\nsigni\\ufb01cant increases in personnel, contract transportation and fuel costs, which more than o\\ufb00set the favorable \\nimpact of higher sales and slightly higher gross sales margins. McLane\\u2019s grocery and food service operations were \\nsigni\\ufb01cantly a\\ufb00ected in 2021 by upstream supply chain constraints, including the e\\ufb00ects of labor and truck driver \\nshortages, which contributed to higher inventory costs, and disruptions in inventory availability. These upstream \\nsupply chain e\\ufb00ects, together with the truck driver and warehouse personnel shortages that we experienced, \\nadversely a\\ufb00ected our customer service levels and reduced our operating e\\ufb03ciencies. In response, hiring and wage \\nand bene\\ufb01ts costs increased signi\\ufb01cantly in 2021.

Other earnings consist \\nprimarily of Berkshire parent company investment income and corporate expenses, other intercompany interest \\nincome where the interest expense is included in earnings of the operating businesses and other unallocated \\nincome and income taxes.\\nFinancial Condition \\nOur consolidated balance sheet continues to re\\ufb02ect signi\\ufb01cant liquidity and a very strong capital base. \\nConsolidated shareholders\\u2019 equity at December 31, 2022 was $472.4 billion, a decrease of $33.8 billion since \\nDecember 31, 2021. Net loss attributable to Berkshire shareholders was $22.8 billion and included after-tax losses \\non our investments of approximately $53.4 billion. Over each of the last three years, investment gains and losses \\nfrom changes in the market prices of our investments in equity securities produced signi\\ufb01cant volatility in our \\nearnings. \\nBerkshire\\u2019s common stock repurchase program, as amended, permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and \\nClass B shares at prices below Berkshire\\u2019s intrinsic value, as conservatively determined by Warren Bu\\ufb00ett, \\nBerkshire\\u2019s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive O\\ufb03cer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board. \\nThe program does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased and does not require any speci\\ufb01ed \\nrepurchase amount. The program is expected to continue inde\\ufb01nitely. We will not repurchase our stock if it reduces \\nthe total amount of Berkshire\\u2019s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bill holdings below $30 \\nbillion. Financial strength and redundant liquidity will always be of paramount importance at Berkshire. Berkshire \\npaid $7.9 billion during 2022 to repurchase shares of its Class A and Class B common stock.\\nAt December 31, 2022, our insurance and other businesses held cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills \\nof $125.0 billion, which included $94.7 billion in U.S. Treasury Bills. Investments in equity and \\ufb01xed maturity \\nsecurities (excluding our investments in Kraft Heinz and Occidental common stock) were $333.9 billion. During \\n2022, we paid cash of $67.9 billion to acquire equity securities and we received proceeds of $33.7 billion from sales \\nof equity securities. On October 19, 2022, we acquired Alleghany Corporation for $11.5 billion, which held cash and \\ninvestments of $19.7 billion as of the acquisition date. On January 31, 2023, we acquired an additional 41.4% \\ninterest in Pilot for approximately $8.2 billion, which was based on Pilot\\u2019s unaudited earnings in 2022 and its net \\ndebt as of December 31, 2022 and is subject to post-closing adjustments following the completion of the audit of \\nPilot\\u2019s 2022 consolidated \\ufb01nancial statements. \\nOur consolidated borrowings at December 31, 2022 were $122.7 billion, of which approximately 94% were by \\nthe Berkshire parent company, BHFC, BNSF and BHE and its subsidiaries. During 2022, Berkshire and certain of its \\nsubsidiaries issued term debt of approximately $12.7 billion in the aggregate and paid approximately $3.9 billion of \\nmaturing senior debt. Expected principal and interest payments related to our consolidated borrowings in each of \\nthe next \\ufb01ve years are (in billions): $17.4 in 2023; $10.4 in 2024; $11.0 in 2025; $8.7 in 2026; and $8.1 in 2027.\\nBerkshire parent company debt outstanding at December 31, 2022 was $21.4 billion, substantially unchanged \\nfrom December 31, 2021. In 2022, Berkshire issued an aggregate \\u00a5243.5 billion (approximately $1.94 billion) of \\nsenior notes with maturity dates ranging from 2025 to 2052 and a weighted average interest rate of 0.8%. \\nBerkshire\\u2019s borrowings decreased $1.4 billion during 2022 from changes in foreign currency exchange rates on its \\nnon-U.S. Dollar denominated debt. \\nBerkshire\\u2019s insurance and other subsidiary outstanding borrowings were approximately $25.1 billion at \\nDecember 31, 2022, an increase of $7.3 billion since December 31, 2021. Senior note borrowings of BHFC, a \\nwholly-owned \\ufb01nancing subsidiary, were approximately $17.9 billion at December 31, 2022, an increase of $4.8 \\nbillion since December 31, 2021, re\\ufb02ecting the issuance of debt, repayments of maturing debt ($775 million) and \\nreductions in the carrying value of non-U.S. denominated debt due to foreign currency exchange rate changes \\n($300 million). In 2022, BHFC issued $4.5 billion of senior notes maturing in 2027, 2032 and 2052 with a weighted \\naverage interest rate of 3.4% and \\u20ac1.25 billion (approximately $1.4 billion) of senior notes maturing in 2030 and \\n2034 with a weighted average interest rate of 1.8%. BHFC\\u2019s borrowings are used to fund a portion of loans \\noriginated and acquired by Clayton Homes and equipment held for lease by our railcar leasing business. Berkshire \\nguarantees BHFC\\u2019s senior notes for the full and timely payment of principal and interest. Subsidiary borrowings as \\nof December 31, 2022 included approximately $2.3 billion attributable to Alleghany and its subsidiaries.\\nK-57 \\u00a0\\nManagement\\u2019s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) \\nFinancial Condition (Continued)\\nBNSF\\u2019s outstanding debt was $23.5 billion as of December 31, 2022, an increase of $233 million from \\nDecember 31, 2021. In 2022, BNSF issued $1.0 billion of 4.45% debentures due in 2053 and repaid approximately \\n$900 million of term debt. Outstanding borrowings of BHE and its subsidiaries were $52.8 billion at December 31, \\n2022, an increase of $1.0 billion since December 31, 2021. In 2022, BHE issued $1.0 billion of 4.6% senior notes \\ndue in 2053. During 2022, BHE subsidiaries issued approximately $3.0 billion of term debt with a weighted average \\ninterest rate of 5.2% at December 31, 2022 and maturity dates ranging from 2024 to 2053. Berkshire does not \\nguarantee the repayment of debt issued by BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries.\\nIn each of the past three years, our diverse group of businesses generated net operating cash \\ufb02ows between \\n$37 billion and $40 billion. Our consolidated capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment and equipment \\nheld for lease were $15.5 billion in 2022, which included capital expenditures by our railroad, utilities and energy \\nbusinesses (BNSF and BHE) of $11.0 billion. BNSF and BHE maintain very large investments in capital assets \\n(property, plant and equipment) and will regularly make signi\\ufb01cant capital expenditures in the normal course of \\nbusiness. We forecast capital expenditures of these two operations will approximate $13.7 billion in 2023.\\nOn August 16, 2022, the In\\ufb02ation Reduction Act of 2022 (\\u201cthe 2022 act\\u201d) was signed into law. The 2022 act \\ncontains numerous provisions, including a 15% corporate alternative minimum income tax on \\u201cadjusted \\ufb01nancial \\nstatement income\\u201d, expanded tax credits for clean energy incentives and a 1% excise tax on corporate stock \\nrepurchases. The provisions of the 2022 act become e\\ufb00ective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. On \\nDecember 27, 2022, the IRS and Department of Treasury issued initial guidance for taxpayers subject to the \\ncorporate alternative minimum tax. The guidance addresses several, but not all, issues that needed clari\\ufb01cation. \\nThe IRS and Department of Treasury intend to release additional guidance in the future. We will continue to \\nevaluate the impact of the Act as more guidance becomes available. We currently do not expect a material impact \\non our consolidated \\ufb01nancial statements. \\nContractual Obligations \\nWe are party to other contracts associated with ongoing business activities, which will result in cash payments \\nto counterparties in future periods. Certain obligations are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as \\noperating lease liabilities and shared aircraft repurchase liabilities of NetJets. Estimated payments of these liabilities \\nin each of the next \\ufb01ve years are (in billions): $1.8 in 2023; $1.6 in 2024; $1.4 in 2025; $1.3 in 2026; and $1.5 in \\n2027.\\nWe are also obligated to pay claims arising from our property and casualty insurance companies. Such \\nliabilities, including amounts from retroactive reinsurance, were approximately $143 billion at December 31, 2022. \\nWe currently forecast claim payments in 2023 of approximately $35 billion with respect to claims occurring prior to \\n2023. Additionally, we estimate net payments of approximately $2 billion in 2023 for life, health and annuity \\nbene\\ufb01ts under contracts. However, the timing and amount of the payments under insurance and reinsurance \\ncontracts are contingent upon the outcome of future events. Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps materially, \\nfrom the forecasted payments, as well as from the liabilities currently recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. \\nWe anticipate that these payments will be funded by operating cash \\ufb02ows.\\nOther obligations pertaining to the acquisition of goods or services in the future, such as certain purchase \\nobligations, are not currently re\\ufb02ected in the Consolidated Financial Statements and will be recognized in future \\nperiods as the goods are delivered or services are provided. As of December 31, 2022, the largest categories of our \\nlong-term contractual obligations primarily related to fuel, capacity, transmission and maintenance contracts and \\ncapital expenditure commitments of BHE and BNSF, aircraft purchase commitments of NetJets and certain raw \\nmaterials purchase commitments. We estimate future payments associated with these contracts over the next \\ufb01ve \\nyears of approximately $24 billion, including $12 billion in 2023. \\nCritical Accounting Policies \\nCertain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments in determining the amounts re\\ufb02ected \\nin our Consolidated Financial Statements. Such estimates and judgments necessarily involve varying and possibly \\nsigni\\ufb01cant degrees of uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts currently recorded in our Consolidated Financial \\nStatements will likely be adjusted in the future based on new available information and changes in other facts and \\ncircumstances. A discussion of our principal accounting policies that required the application of signi\\ufb01cant \\njudgments as of December 31, 2022 follows. \\nK-58 \\u00a0\\nManagement\\u2019s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) \\nProperty and casualty insurance unpaid losses \\nWe record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (also referred to as \\u201cgross unpaid losses\\u201d \\nor \\u201cclaim liabilities\\u201d) based upon estimates of the ultimate amounts payable for loss events occurring on or before \\nthe balance sheet date. The timing and amount of ultimate loss payments are contingent upon, among other \\nthings, the timing of claim reporting from insureds and ceding companies and the \\ufb01nal determination of the loss \\namount through the loss adjustment and settlement process. We use a variety of techniques in establishing claim \\nliabilities, which may require signi\\ufb01cant judgments and assumptions. \\nAs of the balance sheet date, recorded claim liabilities include estimates for reported claims and for incurred-\\nbut-not-reported (\\u201cIBNR\\u201d) claims. The period between the loss occurrence date and loss settlement date is the \\n\\u201cclaim-tail.\\u201d Property claims usually have relatively short claim-tails, absent litigation. Casualty claims usually have \\nlonger claim-tails, occasionally extending for decades. Casualty claims may be more susceptible to litigation and \\nthe impact of changing contract interpretations. The legal environment and judicial process further contribute to \\nextending claim-tails. \\nOur consolidated claim liabilities, including liabilities from retroactive reinsurance contracts, as of December \\n31, 2022 were approximately $143 billion, of which 78% related to GEICO and the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance \\nGroup. Additional information regarding signi\\ufb01cant uncertainties inherent in the processes and techniques for \\nestimating unpaid losses of these businesses follows. \\nGEICO \\nGEICO predominantly writes private passenger automobile insurance. As of December 31, 2022, GEICO\\u2019s \\ngross unpaid losses were $24.8 billion and claim liabilities, net of reinsurance recoverable, were $23.8 billion. \\nGEICO\\u2019s claim reserving methodologies produce liability estimates based upon the individual claims. The key \\nassumptions a\\ufb00ecting our liability estimates include projections of ultimate claim counts (\\u201cfrequency\\u201d) and average \\nloss per claim (\\u201cseverity\\u201d). We utilize a combination of several actuarial estimation methods, including Bornhuetter-\\nFerguson and chain-ladder methodologies. \\nClaim liability estimates for automobile liability coverages (such as bodily injury (\\u201cBI\\u201d), uninsured motorists, \\nand personal injury protection) are more uncertain due to the longer claim-tails, so we establish additional case \\ndevelopment estimates. As of December 31, 2022, case development liabilities averaged approximately 38% of the \\ncase reserves. We select case development factors through analysis of the overall adequacy of historical case \\nliabilities. \\nIBNR claim liabilities are based on projections of the ultimate number of claims expected (reported and \\nunreported) for each signi\\ufb01cant coverage. We use historical claim count data to develop age-to-age projections of \\nthe ultimate counts by quarterly accident period, from which we deduct reported claims to produce the number of \\nunreported claims. We estimate the average costs per unreported claim and apply such estimates to the \\nunreported claim counts, producing an IBNR liability estimate. We may record additional IBNR estimates when \\nactuarial techniques are di\\ufb03cult to apply. \\nWe test the adequacy of the aggregate claim liabilities using one or more actuarial projections based on claim \\nclosure models and paid and incurred loss triangles. Each type of projection analyzes loss occurrence data for \\nclaims occurring in a given period and projects the ultimate cost. \\nOur claim liability estimates recorded at the end of 2021 were reduced by $653 million during 2022, which \\nproduced a corresponding increase to pre-tax earnings. The assumptions used to estimate liabilities at December \\n31, 2022 re\\ufb02ect the most recent frequency and severity estimates. Future development of recorded liabilities will \\ndepend on whether actual frequency and severity of claims are more or less than anticipated. \\nWith respect to liabilities for BI claims, we believe it is reasonably possible that average claims severities will \\nchange by at least one percentage point from the projected severities used in establishing the recorded liabilities at \\nDecember 31, 2022. We estimate that a one percentage point increase or decrease in BI severities would produce a \\n$245 million increase or decrease in recorded liabilities, with a corresponding decrease or increase in pre-tax \\nearnings. Many of the economic forces that would likely cause BI severity to di\\ufb00er from expectations would likely \\nalso cause severities for other injury coverages to di\\ufb00er in the same direction. \\nK-59 \\u00a0\\nManagement\\u2019s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) \\nProperty and casualty insurance unpaid losses (Continued)\\nBerkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group \\nBHRG\\u2019s liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses derive primarily from reinsurance contracts \\nissued through the NICO, General Re and TransRe Groups.

Under certain contracts, coverage can \\napply to multiple lines of business written and the ceding company may not report loss data by such lines \\nconsistently, if at all. In those instances, we judgmentally allocate losses to property and casualty coverages based \\non internal estimates. \\nIn connection with reinsurance contracts, the nature, extent, timing and perceived reliability of loss \\ninformation received from ceding companies varies widely depending on the type of coverage and the contractual \\nreporting terms. Reinsurance contract terms, conditions and coverages also tend to lack standardization and may \\nevolve more rapidly than primary insurance policies. \\nThe nature and extent of loss information provided under many facultative (individual risk) or per occurrence \\nexcess contracts may be comparable to the information received under a primary insurance contract. However, loss \\ninformation with respect to aggregate excess-of-loss and quota-share contracts is often in a summary format rather \\nthan on an individual claim basis. Loss data includes currently recoverable paid losses, as well as case loss \\nestimates. Ceding companies infrequently provide reliable IBNR loss estimates. \\nLoss reporting to reinsurers is typically slower than primary insurers. In the U.S., client reporting is generally \\nrequired at quarterly intervals ranging from 30 to 90 days after the end of the quarterly period, while outside of the \\nU.S., reinsurance reporting practices may vary further. In certain countries, clients report annually from 90 to 180 \\ndays after the end of the annual period. To the extent that reinsurers assume and cede underlying risks from other \\nreinsurers, further delays in claims reporting may occur. The relative impact of reporting delays on the reinsurer \\nmay vary depending on the type of coverage, contractual reporting terms, the magnitude of the claim relative to \\nthe attachment point of the reinsurance coverage and other reasons. \\nAs reinsurers, the premium and loss data we receive is at least one level removed from the underlying \\nclaimant, so there is a risk that the loss data reported is incomplete, inaccurate or the claim is outside the coverage \\nterms. We maintain certain internal procedures to determine that the information is complete and in compliance \\nwith the contract terms. Generally, our reinsurance contracts permit us to access the ceding company\\u2019s records \\nwith respect to the subject business, thus providing the ability to audit the reported information. In the normal \\ncourse of business, disputes occasionally arise concerning whether claims are covered by our reinsurance policies. \\nWe resolve most coverage disputes through negotiation with the client. If disputes cannot be resolved, our \\ncontracts generally provide arbitration or alternative dispute resolution processes. We believe there are no \\ncoverage disputes at this time for which an adverse resolution would likely have a material impact on our \\nconsolidated results of operations or \\ufb01nancial condition. \\nEstablishing claim liability estimates for reinsurance assumed requires evaluation of loss information received \\nfrom our clients. We generally rely on the ceding companies\\u2019 reported case loss estimates. We independently \\nevaluate certain reported case losses and if appropriate, we use our own case liability estimate. For instance, as of \\nDecember 31, 2022, our case loss estimates exceeded ceding company estimates by approximately $650 million \\nfor certain legacy workers\\u2019 compensation claims occurring over 10 years ago. We also periodically conduct detailed \\nreviews of individual client claims, which may cause us to adjust our case estimates. \\nK-60 \\u00a0\\nManagement\\u2019s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) \\nProperty and casualty insurance unpaid losses (Continued)\\nBerkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued)\\nAlthough liabilities for losses are initially determined based on pricing and underwriting analysis, we use a \\nvariety of actuarial methodologies that place reliance on the extrapolation of historical data, loss development \\npatterns, industry data and other benchmarks. The estimate of the IBNR liabilities also requires judgment by \\nactuaries and management to re\\ufb02ect the impact of additional factors like change in business mix, volume, claim \\nreporting and handling practices, in\\ufb02ation, social and legal environment and the terms and conditions of the \\ncontracts. The methodologies generally fall into or are hybrids of one or more of the following categories:\\nPaid and incurred loss development methods \\u2013 These methods consider expected case loss emergence and \\ndevelopment patterns, together with expected loss ratios by year. Factors a\\ufb00ecting our loss development analysis \\ninclude, but are not limited to, changes in the following: client claims reporting and settlement practices, the \\nfrequency of client company claim reviews, policy terms and coverage (such as loss retention levels and occurrence \\nand aggregate policy limits), loss trends and legal trends that result in unanticipated losses. Collectively, these \\nfactors in\\ufb02uence our selections of expected case loss emergence patterns.\\nIncurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods \\u2013 These methods consider actual paid and incurred \\nlosses and expected patterns of paid and incurred losses, taking the initial expected ultimate losses into account to \\ndetermine an estimate of the expected unpaid or unreported losses.\\nFrequency and severity methods \\u2013 These methods commonly focus on a review of the number of anticipated \\nclaims and the anticipated claims severity and may also rely on development patterns to derive such estimates. \\nHowever, our processes and techniques for estimating liabilities in such analyses generally rely more on a per-\\npolicy assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss rather than with an analysis of historical \\ndevelopment patterns of past losses.\\nAdditional analysis \\u2013 In some cases we have established reinsurance claim liabilities on a contract-by-contract \\nbasis, determined from case loss estimates reported by the ceding company and IBNR liabilities that are primarily a \\nfunction of an anticipated loss ratio for the contract and the reported case loss estimate. Liabilities are adjusted \\nupward or downward over time to re\\ufb02ect case losses reported versus expected case losses, which we use to form \\nrevised judgment on the adequacy of the expected loss ratio and the level of IBNR liabilities required for unreported \\nclaims. Anticipated loss ratios are also revised to include estimates of known major catastrophe events. \\nOur claim liability estimation process for short-tail lines, primarily property exposures, utilizes a combination \\nof the paid and incurred loss development methods and the incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods. \\nCertain catastrophe, individual risk and aviation excess-of-loss contracts tend to generate low frequency/high \\nseverity losses. Our processes and techniques for estimating liabilities under such contracts generally rely more on \\na per contract assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss event rather than with an \\nanalysis of the historical development patterns of past losses. \\nFor our long-tail lines, primarily casualty exposures, we may rely on di\\ufb00erent methods depending on the \\nmaturity of the business, with estimates for the most recent years being based on priced loss expectations and \\nmore mature years re\\ufb02ecting the paid or incurred development pattern indications.\\nIn 2022, certain workers\\u2019 compensation claims reported losses were less than expected. As a result, we \\nreduced estimated ultimate losses for prior years\\u2019 loss events by $114 million. We estimate that increases of ten \\npercent in the tail of the expected loss emergence pattern and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net \\nincrease of approximately $1.1 billion in IBNR liabilities, producing a corresponding decrease in pre-tax earnings. \\nWe believe it is reasonably possible for these assumptions to increase at these rates. \\nFor other casualty losses, other than asbestos, environmental and other latent injury claims, we reduced \\nestimated ultimate liabilities for prior years\\u2019 events by approximately $650 million in 2022. For certain signi\\ufb01cant \\ncasualty and general liability portfolios, we estimate that increases of \\ufb01ve percent in the claim-tails of the expected \\nloss emergence patterns and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in our nominal IBNR liabilities \\nand a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $980 million, although outcomes of greater \\nthan or less than $980 million are possible given the diversi\\ufb01cation in worldwide business. \\nThe change in estimated ultimate liabilities for asbestos, environmental and other latent injury claims, \\nexcluding amounts assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts was not signi\\ufb01cant in 2022. Net liabilities for \\nsuch claims were approximately $2.1 billion at December 31, 2022. Loss estimations for these exposures are \\ndi\\ufb03cult to determine due to the changing legal environment and increases may be required in the future if new \\nexposures or claimants are identi\\ufb01ed, new claims are reported or new theories of liability emerge. \\nK-61 \\u00a0\\nManagement\\u2019s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) \\nProperty and casualty insurance unpaid losses (Continued)\\nRetroactive reinsurance \\nOur retroactive reinsurance contracts cover loss events occurring before the contract inception dates. Claim \\nliabilities associated with our retroactive reinsurance contracts predominately pertain to casualty or liability \\nexposures. We expect the claim-tails to be very long. At December 31, 2022, gross unpaid losses were $35.4 billion \\nand deferred charges were $9.9 billion. \\nOur contracts are generally subject to maximum limits of indemni\\ufb01cations and, as such, we currently expect \\nthat maximum remaining gross losses payable under our retroactive policies will not exceed $52 billion. Absent \\nsigni\\ufb01cant judicial or legislative changes a\\ufb00ecting asbestos, environmental or latent injury exposures, we also \\ncurrently believe it unlikely that losses will develop upward to the maximum losses payable or downward by more \\nthan 15% of our estimated gross liability. \\nWe establish liability estimates by individual contract, considering exposure and development trends. In \\nestablishing our liability estimates, we often analyze historical aggregate loss payment patterns and project \\nexpected ultimate losses under various scenarios. We assign judgmental probability factors to these scenarios and \\nan expected outcome is determined. We then monitor subsequent loss payment activity and review ceding \\ncompany reports and other available information concerning the underlying losses. We re-estimate the expected \\nultimate losses when signi\\ufb01cant events or signi\\ufb01cant deviations from expectations are revealed. \\nCertain of our retroactive reinsurance contracts include asbestos, environmental and other latent injury \\nclaims. Our estimated liabilities for such claims were approximately $12.1 billion at December 31, 2022. We do not \\nconsistently receive reliable detailed data regarding asbestos, environmental and latent injury claims from all \\nceding companies, particularly with respect to multi-line or aggregate excess-of-loss policies. When possible, we \\nconduct a detailed analysis of the underlying loss data to make an estimate of ultimate reinsured losses. When \\ndetailed loss information is unavailable, we develop estimates by applying recent industry trends and projections to \\naggregate client data. Judgments in these areas necessarily consider the stability of the legal and regulatory \\nenvironment under which we expect claims will be adjudicated. Legal reform and legislation could also have a \\nsigni\\ufb01cant impact on our ultimate liabilities. \\nWe increased estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years\\u2019 retroactive reinsurance contracts by $86 million in \\n2022. In 2022, we paid losses and loss adjustment expenses of $2.4 billion with respect to our retroactive \\nreinsurance contracts. \\nIn connection with our retroactive reinsurance contracts, we also record deferred charges, which at contract \\ninception represents the excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate liability for unpaid losses over premiums received. \\nWe amortize deferred charges, which produces charges to pre-tax earnings in future periods based on the expected \\ntiming and amount of loss payments. We adjust deferred charge balances due to changes in the expected timing \\nand ultimate amount of claim payments and the e\\ufb00ects of the adjustments are included in pre-tax earnings. \\nSigni\\ufb01cant changes in such estimates may have a signi\\ufb01cant e\\ufb00ect on unamortized deferred charge balances. \\nBased on the contracts in e\\ufb00ect as of December 31, 2022, we estimate that amortization expense in 2023 will \\napproximate $860 million. \\nOther Critical Accounting Policies \\nOur Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2022 includes goodwill of acquired businesses of $78.1 \\nbillion and other inde\\ufb01nite-lived intangible assets of $18.3 billion. We evaluate these assets for impairment \\nannually in the fourth quarter and on an interim basis if the facts and circumstances lead us to believe that more \\nlikely than not there has been an impairment. \\nGoodwill and inde\\ufb01nite-lived intangible asset impairment reviews include determining the estimated fair \\nvalues of our reporting units and inde\\ufb01nite-lived intangible assets. The key assumptions and inputs used in such \\ndeterminations may include forecasting revenues and expenses, cash \\ufb02ows and capital expenditures, as well as an \\nappropriate discount rate and other inputs. Signi\\ufb01cant judgment by management is required in estimating the fair \\nvalue of a reporting unit and in performing impairment reviews. Due to the inherent subjectivity and uncertainty in \\nforecasting future cash \\ufb02ows and earnings over long periods of time, actual results may di\\ufb00er materially from the \\nforecasts. If the carrying value of the inde\\ufb01nite-lived intangible asset exceeds fair value, the excess is charged to \\nearnings as an impairment loss. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value of the \\nreporting unit, then the excess, limited to the carrying amount of goodwill, will be charged to earnings as an \\nimpairment loss.\\nK-62 \\u00a0\\nManagement\\u2019s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) \\nOther Critical Accounting Policies (Continued)\\nAs of December 31, 2022, we concluded it was more likely than not that goodwill recorded in our Consolidated \\nBalance Sheet was not impaired. The fair value estimates of reporting units are and will likely be signi\\ufb01cantly \\na\\ufb00ected by assumptions on the long-term e\\ufb00ects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the reporting units businesses, as \\nwell as other assumptions concerning the long-term economic performance of the reporting units, which we cannot \\nreliably predict. Consequently, any fair value estimates can be subject to wide variations. \\nWe primarily use discounted projected future earnings or cash \\ufb02ow methods in determining fair values. The \\nkey assumptions and inputs used in such methods may include forecasting revenues and expenses, cash \\ufb02ows and \\ncapital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs. A signi\\ufb01cant amount of judgment is \\nrequired in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing goodwill impairment tests. \\nIn connection with the annual goodwill impairment review conducted in the fourth quarter of 2022, the \\nestimated fair values of six reporting units did not exceed our carrying values by at least 20%. The most signi\\ufb01cant \\nof these reporting units was Precision Castparts Corp. (\\u201cPCC\\u201d). Our estimated fair value of PCC was approximately \\n$31.5 billion, exceeding our carrying value of approximately $30.3 billion by 4.0%. Our carrying value of PCC \\nincluded goodwill of approximately $7.5 billion. For the \\ufb01ve other reporting units, our aggregate estimated fair \\nvalue was approximately $4.5 billion, which exceeded our aggregate carrying value of approximately $4.1 billion by \\n9.9%. Our carrying value of these units included goodwill of approximately $1.4 billion.\\nIn the second quarter of 2020, we quantitively reevaluated goodwill for impairment for certain reporting units, \\nand most signi\\ufb01cantly for PCC. As a result of our reviews, we recorded pre-tax goodwill impairment charges of $10 \\nbillion and inde\\ufb01nite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $638 million, of which approximately $10 billion \\nrelated to PCC. Prior to the reevaluation, the carrying value of PCC-related goodwill was approximately $17 billion. \\nAdditionally, the carrying value of PCC-related inde\\ufb01nite-lived intangible assets was approximately $14 billion. \\nSubstantially all of these amounts were recorded in connection with Berkshire\\u2019s acquisition of PCC in 2016. The \\ninitial e\\ufb00ects of the COVID-19 pandemic on commercial airlines and aircraft manufacturers were particularly severe. \\nAt that time, we considered several factors in our reevaluation, including but not limited to the announcements by \\nairlines concerning potential future demand, employment levels and aircraft orders, announcements by \\nmanufacturers of reduced aircraft production and the actions we were taking to restructure operations. \\nConsequently, we deemed it prudent under the prevailing circumstances to increase discount rates and reduce \\nprior long-term forecasts of future cash \\ufb02ows for purposes of reviewing for impairments. \\nMarket Risk Disclosures \\nOur Consolidated Balance Sheets include substantial amounts of assets and liabilities whose fair values are \\nsubject to market risks. Our signi\\ufb01cant market risks are primarily associated with equity prices, interest rates, \\nforeign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The fair values of our investment portfolios remain subject \\nto considerable volatility. The following sections address the signi\\ufb01cant market risks associated with our business \\nactivities.\\nEquity Price Risk \\nEquity securities represent the most signi\\ufb01cant portion of our consolidated investment portfolio. Strategically, \\nwe strive to invest in businesses that possess excellent economics and able and honest management, and we \\nprefer to invest a meaningful amount in each company. Historically, equity investments have been concentrated in \\nrelatively few issuers. At December 31, 2022, approximately 75% of the total fair value of equity securities was \\nconcentrated in \\ufb01ve companies. \\nWe often hold our equity securities for long periods and short-term price volatility has occurred in the past and \\nwill occur in the future. We also strive to maintain signi\\ufb01cant levels of shareholder capital and ample liquidity to \\nprovide a margin of safety against short-term price volatility. \\nK-63 \\u00a0\\nManagement\\u2019s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) \\nEquity Price Risk (Continued)\\nFor the past several years, we were also subject to equity price risk with respect to our equity index put option \\ncontracts. However, substantially all of the contracts written to date have expired. \\nThe following table summarizes our signi\\ufb01cant assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and \\nthe estimated e\\ufb00ects of a hypothetical 30% increase and a 30% decrease in market prices as of those dates. The \\nselected 30% hypothetical increase and decrease does not re\\ufb02ect the best or worst case scenario. Indeed, results \\nfrom declines could be far worse due both to the nature of equity markets and the aforementioned concentrations \\nexisting in our equity investment portfolio.

Our strategy is to acquire or \\noriginate such instruments at prices considered appropriate relative to the perceived credit risk. We also issue debt \\nin the ordinary course of business to fund business operations, business acquisitions and for other general \\npurposes. We attempt to maintain high credit ratings in order to minimize the cost of our debt. We infrequently \\nutilize derivative products, such as interest rate swaps, to manage interest rate risks and we do not attempt to \\nmatch maturities of assets and liabilities. \\nThe fair values of our \\ufb01xed maturity investments, loans and \\ufb01nance receivables and notes payable and other \\nborrowings will \\ufb02uctuate in response to changes in market interest rates. Increases and decreases in interest rates \\ngenerally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of these instruments. Additionally, fair values of \\ninterest rate sensitive instruments may be a\\ufb00ected by the creditworthiness of the issuer, prepayment options, \\nrelative values of alternative investments, the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions. \\nK-64(1)\\n(1) \\u00a0\\nManagement\\u2019s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) \\nInterest Rate Risk (Continued)\\nThe following table summarizes the estimated e\\ufb00ects of hypothetical changes in interest rates on our \\nsigni\\ufb01cant assets and liabilities that are subject to signi\\ufb01cant interest rate risk at December 31, 2022 and 2021. We \\nassumed that the interest rate changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument and that \\nthere were no signi\\ufb01cant changes to other factors used to determine the value of the instrument.

Our responsibility \\nis to express an opinion on these \\ufb01nancial statements and an opinion on the Company\\u2019s internal control over \\n\\ufb01nancial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting \\ufb01rm registered with the Public Company \\nAccounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the \\nCompany in accordance with the US federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the \\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and \\nperform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the \\ufb01nancial statements are free of material \\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether e\\ufb00ective internal control over \\ufb01nancial reporting was \\nmaintained in all material respects. \\nOur audits of the \\ufb01nancial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement \\nof the \\ufb01nancial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. \\nSuch procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the \\n\\ufb01nancial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and signi\\ufb01cant estimates \\nmade by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the \\ufb01nancial statements. Our audit of \\ninternal control over \\ufb01nancial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over \\ufb01nancial \\nreporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating \\ne\\ufb00ectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.

A company\\u2019s internal control over \\ufb01nancial reporting \\nincludes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, \\naccurately and fairly re\\ufb02ect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable \\nassurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of \\ufb01nancial statements in accordance \\nwith generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made \\nonly in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable \\nassurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the \\ncompany\\u2019s assets that could have a material e\\ufb00ect on the \\ufb01nancial statements. \\nK-67 \\u00a0\\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM (Continued)\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over \\ufb01nancial reporting may not prevent or detect \\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of e\\ufb00ectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that \\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the \\npolicies or procedures may deteriorate. \\nCritical Audit Matters\\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the \\ufb01nancial \\nstatements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to \\naccounts or disclosures that are material to the \\ufb01nancial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, \\nsubjective, or complex judgments.

The Company evaluates goodwill and \\ninde\\ufb01nite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually. When evaluating goodwill and inde\\ufb01nite-lived \\nintangible assets for impairment, the fair value of each reporting unit or asset is estimated. Signi\\ufb01cant judgment is \\nrequired in estimating fair values and performing impairment tests. The Company primarily uses discounted \\nprojected future net earnings or net cash \\ufb02ows and multiples of earnings to estimate fair value, which requires \\nmanagement to make signi\\ufb01cant estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future revenue, earnings before \\ninterest and taxes (\\u201cEBIT\\u201d), and discount rates. Changes in these assumptions could have a signi\\ufb01cant impact on \\nthe fair value of reporting units and inde\\ufb01nite-lived intangible assets.\\nThe Precision Castparts Corp. (\\u201cPCC\\u201d) reporting unit reported approximately $8 billion of goodwill and \\napproximately $13 billion of inde\\ufb01nite-lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2022. Given the signi\\ufb01cant \\njudgments made by management to estimate the fair value of the PCC reporting unit and certain customer \\nrelationships with inde\\ufb01nite lives along with the di\\ufb00erence between their fair values and carrying values, \\nperforming audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management\\u2019s estimates and assumptions related \\nto forecasts of future revenue and EBIT and the selection of the discount rate required a high degree of auditor \\njudgment and an increased extent of e\\ufb00ort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists.\\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\\nOur audit procedures related to forecasts of future revenue and EBIT and the selection of the discount rate for the \\nPCC reporting unit and certain customer relationships included the following, among others:\\n\\u2022We tested the e\\ufb00ectiveness of controls over goodwill and inde\\ufb01nite-lived intangible assets, including those \\nover the forecasts of future revenue and EBIT and the selection of the discount rate.\\n\\u2022We evaluated management\\u2019s ability to accurately forecast future revenue and EBIT by comparing prior year \\nforecasts to actual results in the respective years.\\n\\u2022We evaluated the reasonableness of management\\u2019s current revenue and EBIT forecasts by comparing the \\nforecasts to historical results, newly executed long-term contracts, customer demand and build schedules, \\nforecasted information included in analyst and industry reports and certain peer companies\\u2019 disclosures. \\n\\u2022With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the valuation methodologies, the terminal \\ngrowth rates and discount rate, including testing the underlying source information and the mathematical \\naccuracy of the calculations, and developed a range of independent estimates and compared those to the \\nterminal growth rates and discount rate selected by management.\\n/s/  Deloitte & Touche LLP\\nOmaha, Nebraska  \\nFebruary 25, 2023 \\nWe have served as the Company\\u2019s auditor since 1985. \\nK-69 \\u00a0\\nBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY

2022\\n(1)Signi\\ufb01cant accounting policies and practices \\n(a)Nature of operations and basis of consolidation \\nBerkshire Hathaway Inc. (\\u201cBerkshire\\u201d) is a holding company owning subsidiaries engaged in numerous \\ndiverse business activities, including insurance and reinsurance, freight rail transportation, utilities and \\nenergy, manufacturing, service and retailing. In these notes the terms \\u201cus,\\u201d \\u201cwe,\\u201d or \\u201cour\\u201d refer to Berkshire \\nand its consolidated subsidiaries. Further information regarding our reportable business segments is contained \\nin Note 25. Information concerning signi\\ufb01cant business acquisitions completed over the past three years \\nappears in Note 2. We believe that reporting the Railroad, Utilities and Energy subsidiaries separately is \\nappropriate given the relative signi\\ufb01cance of their long-lived assets, capital expenditures and debt, which is \\nnot guaranteed by Berkshire. \\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Berkshire consolidated \\nwith the accounts of all subsidiaries and a\\ufb03liates in which we hold a controlling \\ufb01nancial interest as of the \\n\\ufb01nancial statement date. Normally a controlling \\ufb01nancial interest re\\ufb02ects ownership of a majority of the voting \\ninterests. We consolidate variable interest entities (\\u201cVIE\\u201d) when we possess both the power to direct the \\nactivities of the VIE that most signi\\ufb01cantly a\\ufb00ect its economic performance, and we (a) are obligated to \\nabsorb the losses that could be signi\\ufb01cant to the VIE or (b) hold the right to receive bene\\ufb01ts from the VIE that \\ncould be signi\\ufb01cant to the VIE. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Certain \\nimmaterial balances in the Consolidated Financial Statements have been reclassi\\ufb01ed in prior years to conform \\nto current year presentations.\\n(b)Use of estimates in preparation of \\ufb01nancial statements \\nWe prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally \\naccepted in the United States (\\u201cGAAP\\u201d) which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that a\\ufb00ect the \\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the reported amounts of revenues \\nand expenses during the period. Our estimates of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are subject to \\nconsiderable estimation error due to the inherent uncertainty in projecting ultimate claim costs. In addition, \\nestimates and assumptions associated with the amortization of deferred charges on retroactive reinsurance \\ncontracts, determinations of fair values of certain \\ufb01nancial instruments and evaluations of goodwill and \\ninde\\ufb01nite-lived intangible assets for impairment require considerable judgment. Actual results may di\\ufb00er from \\nthe estimates used in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements. \\nTo varying degrees the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences continues to a\\ufb00ect our operating \\nbusinesses. Signi\\ufb01cant government and private sector actions have been taken since 2020 to control the \\nspread and mitigate the economic e\\ufb00ects of the virus and its variants. Such actions in 2022 included \\ntemporary business closures or restrictions of business activities in various parts of the world. In addition, \\nsigni\\ufb01cant disruptions of supply chains and higher costs emerged in 2021 and persisted in 2022. The \\ndevelopment of geopolitical con\\ufb02icts in 2022 contributed to disruptions of supply chains, resulting in cost \\nincreases for commodities, goods and services in many parts of the world. In the U.S. and elsewhere, \\ngovernments are implementing actions intended to slow price in\\ufb02ation. The economic e\\ufb00ects from these \\nevents over longer terms cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Accordingly, signi\\ufb01cant estimates used \\nin the preparation of our \\ufb01nancial statements, including those associated with evaluations of certain long-lived \\nassets, goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment, expected credit losses on amounts owed to us \\nand the estimations of certain losses assumed under insurance and reinsurance contracts, may be subject to \\nsigni\\ufb01cant adjustments in future periods.\\n(c)Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments in U.S. Treasury Bills \\nCash equivalents consist of demand deposit and money market accounts and investments with \\nmaturities of three months or less when purchased. Short-term investments in U.S. Treasury Bills have \\nmaturities exceeding three months and less than one year at the time of purchase. \\n(d)Investments in \\ufb01xed maturity securities \\nWe classify investments in \\ufb01xed maturity securities on the acquisition date and at each balance sheet \\ndate. Securities classi\\ufb01ed as held-to-maturity are carried at amortized cost, re\\ufb02ecting the ability and intent to \\nhold the securities to maturity. Securities classi\\ufb01ed as trading are acquired with the intent to sell in the near \\nterm and are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings. All other securities are \\nclassi\\ufb01ed as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value. Substantially all of our investments in \\ufb01xed \\nmaturity securities are classi\\ufb01ed as available-for-sale. We amortize the di\\ufb00erence between the original cost \\nand maturity value of a \\ufb01xed maturity security to earnings using the interest method. \\nK-75 \\u00a0\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) \\n(1)Signi\\ufb01cant accounting policies and practices (Continued)\\n(d)Investments in \\ufb01xed maturity securities (Continued) \\nWe record investment gains and losses on available-for-sale \\ufb01xed maturity securities when the securities \\nare sold, determined on a speci\\ufb01c identi\\ufb01cation basis. For securities in an unrealized loss position, we \\nrecognize a loss in earnings for the excess of amortized cost over fair value if we intend to sell before the \\nprice recovers. As of the balance sheet date, we evaluate whether the other unrealized losses are attributable \\nto credit losses or other factors. We consider the severity of the decline in value, creditworthiness of the issuer \\nand other relevant factors. We record an allowance for credit losses, limited to the excess of amortized cost \\nover fair value, with a corresponding charge to earnings if the present value of estimated cash \\ufb02ows is less \\nthan the present value of contractual cash \\ufb02ows. The allowance may be subsequently increased or decreased \\nbased on the prevailing facts and circumstances. The portion of the unrealized loss that we believe is not \\nrelated to a credit loss is recognized in other comprehensive income. \\n(e)Investments in equity securities \\nWe carry substantially all investments in equity securities at fair value and record the subsequent \\nchanges in fair values in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as a component of investment gains or \\nlosses. \\n(f)Investments under the equity method \\nWe utilize the equity method to account for investments when we possess the ability to exercise \\nsigni\\ufb01cant in\\ufb02uence, but not control, over the operating and \\ufb01nancial policies of the investee. The ability to \\nexercise signi\\ufb01cant in\\ufb02uence is presumed when the investor possesses more than 20% of the voting interests \\nof the investee. This presumption may be overcome based on speci\\ufb01c facts and circumstances that \\ndemonstrate that the ability to exercise signi\\ufb01cant in\\ufb02uence is restricted. We apply the equity method to \\ninvestments in common stock and other investments when such investments possess substantially identical \\nsubordinated interests to common stock, and do not apply the equity method to investments that are not in-\\nsubstance common stock as de\\ufb01ned by GAAP. \\nIn applying the equity method, we record the investment at cost and subsequently increase or decrease \\nthe carrying amount of the investment by our proportionate share of the net earnings or losses and other \\ncomprehensive income of the investee. We record dividends or other equity distributions as reductions in the \\ncarrying value of the investment. If net losses reduce our carrying amount to zero, additional net losses may \\nbe recorded if other investments in the investee are at-risk, even if we have not committed to provide \\n\\ufb01nancial support to the investee. Such additional equity method losses, if any, are based upon the change in \\nour claim on the investee\\u2019s book value. \\n(g)Loans and \\ufb01nance receivables \\nLoans and \\ufb01nance receivables are primarily manufactured home loans, and to a lesser extent, \\ncommercial loans and site-built home loans. We carry substantially all loans and \\ufb01nance receivables at \\namortized cost, net of allowances for expected credit losses, based on our ability and intent to hold such loans \\nto maturity. Acquisition costs and loan origination and commitment costs paid and fees received, as well as \\nacquisition premiums or discounts, are amortized as yield adjustments over the lives of the loans. \\nMeasurements of expected credit losses include provisions for non-collection, whether the risk is \\nprobable or remote. Expected credit losses on manufactured home loans are based on the net present value \\nof future principal payments less estimated expenses related to the charge-o\\ufb00 and foreclosure of expected \\nuncollectible loans and include provisions for loans that are not in foreclosure. Our principal credit quality \\nindicator is whether the loans are performing. Expected credit loss estimates consider historical default rates, \\ncollateral recovery rates, historical runo\\ufb00 rates, interest rates, reductions of future cash \\ufb02ows for modi\\ufb01ed \\nloans and the historical time elapsed from last payment until foreclosure, among other factors. In addition, our \\nestimates consider current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts.\\nK-76 \\u00a0\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) \\n(1)Signi\\ufb01cant accounting policies and practices (Continued)\\n(g)Loans and \\ufb01nance receivables (Continued)\\nLoans are considered delinquent when payments are more than 30 days past due. We place loans over \\n90 days past due on nonaccrual status and accrued but uncollected interest is reversed. Subsequent \\ncollections on the loans are \\ufb01rst applied to the principal and interest owed for the most delinquent amount. \\nWe resume interest income accrual once a loan is less than 90 days delinquent. \\nLoans are considered non-performing when the foreclosure process has started. Once a loan is in the \\nprocess of foreclosure, interest income is not recognized until the foreclosure is cured or the loan is modi\\ufb01ed. \\nOnce a modi\\ufb01cation is complete, interest income is recognized based on the terms of the new loan. \\nForeclosed loans are charged o\\ufb00 when the collateral is sold. Loans not in foreclosure are evaluated for charge-\\no\\ufb00 based on individual circumstances concerning the future collectability of the loan and the condition of the \\ncollateral securing the loan. \\n(h)Other receivables \\nOther receivables include balances due from customers, insurance premiums receivable and reinsurance \\nlosses recoverable, as well as other receivables. Trade receivables, insurance premium receivables and other \\nreceivables are primarily short-term in nature with stated collection terms of less than  one year  from the \\ndate of origination. Reinsurance recoverables are comprised of amounts ceded under reinsurance contracts or \\npursuant to mandatory government-sponsored insurance programs. Reinsurance recoverables relate to \\nunpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses arising from property and casualty contracts and bene\\ufb01ts under \\nlife and health contracts. Receivables are stated net of estimated allowances for uncollectible balances. \\nWe measure expected credit losses primarily utilizing credit loss history, with adjustments to re\\ufb02ect \\ncurrent or expected future economic conditions when reasonable and supportable forecasts of losses deviate \\nfrom historical experience. In evaluating expected credit losses of reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses, \\nwe review the credit quality of the counterparty and consider right-of-o\\ufb00set provisions within reinsurance \\ncontracts and other forms of credit enhancement including collateral, guarantees and other available \\ninformation. We charge-o\\ufb00 receivables against the allowances after all reasonable collection e\\ufb00orts are \\nexhausted. \\n(i)Derivatives \\nWe carry assets and liabilities arising from derivative contracts at fair value in other assets and accounts \\npayable, accruals and other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Balances are net of reductions \\npermitted under master netting agreements with counterparties. We record the changes in fair value of \\nderivative contracts that do not qualify as hedging instruments for \\ufb01nancial reporting purposes in earnings or, \\nif such contracts involve our regulated utilities subsidiaries, as regulatory assets or liabilities when inclusion in \\nregulated rates is probable. \\n(j)Fair value measurements \\nAs de\\ufb01ned under GAAP, fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a \\nliability between market participants in the principal market or in the most advantageous market when no \\nprincipal market exists. Adjustments to transaction prices or quoted market prices may be required in illiquid \\nor disorderly markets in estimating fair value. Alternative valuation techniques may be appropriate under the \\ncircumstances to determine the value that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in \\nan orderly transaction. Market participants are assumed to be independent, knowledgeable, and able and \\nwilling to transact an exchange and not acting under duress. Our nonperformance or credit risk is considered \\nin determining the fair value of liabilities. Considerable judgment may be required in interpreting market data \\nused to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, estimates of fair value presented herein are not \\nnecessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized in a current or future market exchange. \\n(k)Inventories \\nInventories consist of manufactured goods, goods or products acquired for resale and homes constructed \\nfor sale. Manufactured inventory costs include materials, direct and indirect labor and factory overhead. At \\nDecember 31, 2022, we used the last-in-\\ufb01rst-out (\\u201cLIFO\\u201d) method to value approximately \\n         \\n          30\\n         % of consolidated inventories with the remainder primarily determined under \\ufb01rst-in-\\ufb01rst-out and \\naverage cost methods. Non-LIFO inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The excess \\nof current or replacement costs over costs determined under LIFO was approximately $\\n         \\n          2.5\\n          billion as of December 31, 2022 and $\\n         \\n          1.9\\n          billion as of December 31, 2021. \\n\\u00a0\\nK-77 \\u00a0\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) \\n(1)Signi\\ufb01cant accounting policies and practices (Continued)\\n(l)Property, plant and equipment and equipment held for lease \\nWe use property, plant and equipment in our operations. We also own equipment that we lease to others \\nunder lease contracts. We record additions to property, plant and equipment and equipment held for lease at \\ncost, which includes asset additions, improvements and betterments. With respect to constructed assets, all \\nmaterials, direct labor and contract services as well as certain indirect costs are capitalized. Indirect costs \\ninclude interest over the construction period. With respect to constructed assets of our utility and energy \\nsubsidiaries that are subject to authoritative guidance for regulated operations, capitalized costs also include \\nan allowance for funds used during construction, which represents the cost of equity funds used to \\ufb01nance the \\nconstruction of the regulated facilities. Normal repairs and maintenance and other costs that do not improve \\nthe property, extend its useful life or otherwise do not meet capitalization criteria are charged to expense as \\nincurred. \\nDepreciation of assets of our regulated utilities and railroad is generally determined using group \\ndepreciation methods where rates are based on periodic depreciation studies approved by the applicable \\nregulator. Under group depreciation, a composite rate is applied to the gross investment in a particular class \\nof property, despite di\\ufb00erences in the service life or salvage value of individual property units within the same \\nclass. When such assets are retired or sold, no gain or loss is recognized. Gains or losses on disposals of all \\nother assets are recorded through earnings. \\nWe depreciate property, plant and equipment used by our other businesses to the estimated salvage \\nvalue primarily using the straight-line method over estimated service lives. Ranges of estimated service lives \\nof depreciable assets used in our other businesses are as follows: buildings and improvements \\u2013  5  to  50 \\nyears, machinery and equipment \\u2013  3  to  25  years and furniture, \\ufb01xtures and other \\u2013  3  to  15  years. Ranges \\nof estimated useful lives of depreciable assets unique to our railroad business are as follows: track structure \\nand other roadway \\u2013  10  to  100 years  and locomotives, freight cars and other equipment \\u2013  6  to  43 years . \\nRanges of estimated useful lives of assets unique to our regulated utilities and energy businesses are as \\nfollows: utility generation, transmission and distribution systems \\u2013  5  to  80 years , interstate natural gas \\npipeline assets \\u2013  3  to  80 years  and independent power plants and other assets \\u2013  2  to  50 years . We \\ndepreciate the equipment held for lease to estimated salvage value primarily using the straight-line method \\nover estimated useful lives ranging from  3  to  35 years . We use declining balance depreciation methods for \\nassets when the revenue-earning power of the asset is greater during the earlier years of its life. \\nWe evaluate property, plant and equipment and equipment held for lease for impairment when events or \\nchanges in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable or when the \\nassets are held for sale. Upon the occurrence of a triggering event, we assess whether the estimated \\nundiscounted cash \\ufb02ows expected from the use of the asset and the residual value from the ultimate disposal \\nof the asset exceeds the carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated recoverable amounts, we \\nreduce the carrying value to fair value and record an impairment loss in earnings, except with respect to \\nimpairment of assets of our regulated utility and energy subsidiaries where the impacts of regulation are \\nconsidered in evaluating the carrying value. \\n(m)Leases \\nWe are party to contracts where we lease property from others. When we lease assets from others, we \\nrecord right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. Right-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying \\nasset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the \\nlease. In this regard, lease payments include \\ufb01xed payments and variable payments that depend on an index \\nor rate. The lease term is generally considered the non-cancellable lease period. Certain lease contracts \\ncontain renewal options or other terms that provide for variable payments based on performance or usage. \\nOptions are not included in determining right-of-use assets or lease liabilities unless it is reasonably certain \\nthat options will be exercised. Generally, incremental borrowing rates are used in measuring lease liabilities. \\nRight-of-use assets are subject to review for impairment. As permitted under GAAP, for some leases we do not \\nseparate lease components from non-lease components by class of asset and we do not record assets or \\nliabilities for leases with terms of one year or less.\\n(n)Goodwill and other intangible assets \\nGoodwill represents the excess of the acquisition price of a business over the fair value of identi\\ufb01ed net \\nassets of that business. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually. When evaluating goodwill for \\nimpairment, we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit. Several methods may be used to estimate a \\nreporting unit\\u2019s fair value, including market quotations, asset and liability fair values and other valuation \\ntechniques, including, but not limited to, discounted projected future net earnings or net cash \\ufb02ows and \\nmultiples of earnings. When the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds the \\nestimated fair value, the excess up to the balance of goodwill is charged to earnings as an impairment loss. \\nK-78 \\u00a0\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) \\n(1)Signi\\ufb01cant accounting policies and practices (Continued)\\n(n)Goodwill and other intangible assets (Continued)\\nIntangible assets with inde\\ufb01nite lives are also tested for impairment at least annually and when events \\nor changes in circumstances indicate that, more-likely-than-not, the asset is impaired. Signi\\ufb01cant judgment is \\nrequired in estimating fair values and performing goodwill and inde\\ufb01nite-lived intangible asset impairment \\ntests. We amortize intangible assets with \\ufb01nite lives in a pattern that re\\ufb02ects the expected consumption of \\nrelated economic bene\\ufb01ts or on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic useful lives. Intangible \\nassets with \\ufb01nite lives are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the \\ncarrying amount may not be recoverable. \\n(o)Revenue recognition \\nWe earn insurance premiums on prospective property/casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts over \\nthe loss exposure or coverage period in proportion to the level of protection provided. Premiums are generally \\nearned in proportion to the coverage provided, which in most cases is ratably over the term of the contract \\nwith unearned premiums computed on a monthly or daily pro-rata basis. Premiums on retroactive \\nproperty/casualty reinsurance contracts are generally received in full and are earned at the inception of the \\ncontracts, as all underlying loss events covered by the policies occurred prior to contract inception. Premiums \\nfor life reinsurance and periodic payment annuity contracts are earned when due. Premiums for periodic \\npayment annuity contracts are received in full at the inception of the contracts. Premiums earned are stated \\nnet of amounts ceded to reinsurers. Premiums earned on contracts with experience-rating provisions re\\ufb02ect \\nestimated loss experience under such contracts. \\nSales and service revenues are recognized when goods or services are transferred to a customer. A good \\nor service is transferred when (or as) the customer obtains control of that good or service. Revenues are \\nbased on the consideration we expect to receive in connection with our promises to deliver goods and \\nservices to our customers. \\nWe manufacture and/or distribute a wide variety of industrial, building and consumer products. Our sales \\ncontracts provide customers with these products directly or through wholesale and retail channels in \\nexchange for consideration speci\\ufb01ed under the contracts. Contracts generally represent customer orders for \\nindividual products at stated prices. Sales contracts may contain either single or multiple performance \\nobligations. In instances where contracts contain multiple performance obligations, we allocate the revenue to \\neach obligation based on the relative stand-alone selling prices of each product or service. \\nSales revenue re\\ufb02ects reductions for returns, allowances, late delivery penalties, volume discounts and \\nother incentives, some of which may be contingent on future events. In certain customer contracts, sales \\nrevenue includes certain state and local excise taxes billed to customers on speci\\ufb01ed products when those \\ntaxes are levied directly upon us by the taxing authorities. Sales revenue excludes sales taxes and value-\\nadded taxes collected on behalf of taxing authorities. Sales revenue includes consideration for shipping and \\nother ful\\ufb01llment activities performed prior to the customer obtaining control of the goods. We also elect to \\ntreat consideration for such services performed after control has passed to the customer as sales revenue. \\nOur product sales revenues are generally recognized at a point in time when control of the product \\ntransfers to the customer, which coincides with customer pickup or product delivery or acceptance, depending \\non terms of the arrangement. We recognize sales revenues and related costs with respect to certain contracts \\nover time, primarily from certain castings, forgings and aerostructures contracts. Control of the product units \\nunder these contracts transfers continuously to the customer as the product is manufactured. These products \\ngenerally have no alternative use and the contract requires the customer to provide reasonable compensation \\nif terminated for reasons other than breach of contract. \\nThe primary performance obligation under our freight rail transportation service contracts is to move \\nfreight from a point of origin to a point of destination. The performance obligations are represented by bills of \\nlading which create a series of distinct services that have a similar pattern of transfer to the customer. The \\nrevenues for each performance obligation are based on various factors including the product being shipped, \\nthe origin and destination pair and contract incentives, which are outlined in various private rate agreements, \\ncommon carrier public tari\\ufb00s, interline foreign road agreements and pricing quotes. The transaction price is \\ngenerally a per car/unit amount to transport railcars from a speci\\ufb01ed origin to a speci\\ufb01ed destination. Freight \\nrevenues are recognized over time as the service is performed because the customer simultaneously receives \\nand consumes the bene\\ufb01ts of the service. Revenues recognized represent the portion of the service \\ncompleted as of the balance sheet date. Invoices for freight transportation services are generally issued to \\ncustomers and paid within 30 days or less. Customer incentives, which are primarily provided for shipping a \\nspeci\\ufb01ed cumulative volume or shipping to/from speci\\ufb01c locations, are recorded as a reduction to revenue on \\na pro-rata basis based on actual or projected future customer shipments. \\nK-79 \\u00a0\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) \\n(1)Signi\\ufb01cant accounting policies and practices (Continued)\\n(o)Revenue recognition (Continued)\\nOur energy revenue derives primarily from tari\\ufb00-based sales arrangements approved by various \\nregulatory commissions. These tari\\ufb00-based revenues are mainly comprised of energy, transmission, \\ndistribution and natural gas and have performance obligations to deliver energy products and services to \\ncustomers which are satis\\ufb01ed over time as energy is delivered or services are provided. Our nonregulated \\nenergy revenue primarily relates to our renewable energy business. Energy revenues are equivalent to the \\namounts we have the right to invoice and correspond directly with the value to the customer of the \\nperformance to date and include billed and unbilled amounts. Payments from customers are generally due \\nwithin 30 days of billing. Rates charged for energy products and services are established by regulators or \\ncontractual arrangements that establish the transaction price, as well as the allocation of price among the \\nseparate performance obligations. When preliminary regulated rates are permitted to be billed prior to \\ufb01nal \\napproval by the applicable regulator, certain revenue collected may be subject to refund and a liability for \\nestimated refunds is accrued. Other service revenues derive from contracts with customers in which \\nperformance obligations are satis\\ufb01ed over time, where customers receive and consume bene\\ufb01ts as we \\nperform the services or at a point in time when the services are provided. Other service revenues primarily \\nderive from real estate brokerage, automotive repair, aircraft management, aviation training, franchising and \\nnews distribution. \\nLeasing revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the lease or based on usage, if \\napplicable under the terms of the contract. A substantial portion of our lessor contracts are classi\\ufb01ed as \\noperating leases. \\n(p)Losses and loss adjustment expenses \\nWe record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under property/casualty insurance \\nand reinsurance contracts for loss events that have occurred on or before the balance sheet date. Such \\nliabilities represent the estimated ultimate payment amounts without discounting for time value. \\nWe base liability estimates on (1) loss reports from policyholders and cedents, (2) individual case \\nestimates and (3) estimates of incurred but not reported losses. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in the \\nConsolidated Statements of Earnings include paid claims, claim settlement costs and changes in estimated \\nclaim liabilities. Losses and loss adjustment expenses charged to earnings are net of amounts recovered and \\nestimates of amounts recoverable under ceded reinsurance contracts. Reinsurance contracts do not relieve \\nthe ceding company of its obligations to indemnify policyholders with respect to the underlying insurance and \\nreinsurance contracts. \\n(q)Retroactive reinsurance contracts \\nWe record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under short duration retroactive \\nreinsurance contracts consistent with property/casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts described in \\nNote 1(p). With respect to retroactive reinsurance contracts, we also record deferred charge assets at the \\ninception of the contracts, representing the excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate claim liabilities over the \\npremiums earned. We subsequently amortize the deferred charge assets over the expected claim settlement \\nperiods using the interest method. Changes to the estimated timing or amount of future loss payments also \\nproduce changes in deferred charge balances. We apply changes in such estimates retrospectively and the \\nresulting changes in deferred charge balances, together with periodic amortization, are included in insurance \\nlosses and loss adjustment expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. \\n(r)Insurance policy acquisition costs \\nWe capitalize the direct incremental costs that relate to the successful sale of insurance contracts, \\nsubject to ultimate recoverability. Direct incremental acquisition costs include commissions, premium taxes \\nand certain other costs associated with successful e\\ufb00orts. We expense all other underwriting costs as \\nincurred. For short duration contracts, we subsequently amortize deferred policy acquisition costs to \\nunderwriting expenses as the related premiums are earned. Acquisition costs related to long duration life \\ninsurance contracts are amortized over the expected premium-paying period in proportion to the anticipated \\npremiums over the life of the policy. Such anticipated premiums are estimated using the same assumptions \\nused for computing liabilities for future policy bene\\ufb01ts. The recoverability of deferred policy acquisition costs \\ngenerally considers anticipated investment income. The unamortized balances are included in other assets \\nand were approximately $\\n         \\n          3.8\\n          billion and $\\n         \\n          3.4\\n          billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which included $\\n         \\n          3.2\\n          billion and $\\n         \\n          2.9\\n          billion, respectively, related to property and casualty insurance contracts. \\nK-80  \\u00a0\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) \\n(1)Signi\\ufb01cant accounting policies and practices (Continued)\\n(s)Life, annuity and health insurance bene\\ufb01ts \\nLiabilities for future life, annuity and health insurance bene\\ufb01ts represent the present value of expected \\nfuture bene\\ufb01ts and non-acquisition variable expenses, less the present value of expected future net premiums \\n(the portion of gross premium required to provide for all expected future bene\\ufb01ts and variable expenses). In \\nestimating future cash \\ufb02ows, we consider the timing and amounts of future claims, premiums and expenses, \\nwhich require estimates concerning future investment yields, expected mortality, morbidity and lapse or \\nwithdrawal rates. These assumptions, as applicable, also include a margin for adverse deviation and may vary \\nwith the characteristics of the contract\\u2019s date of issuance, policy duration and country of risk. The interest rate \\nassumptions used for discounting may vary by contract or underlying currency denomination of our \\nreinsurance contracts. Generally, assumptions regarding cash \\ufb02ow and discount rate are \\ufb01xed at the inception \\nof the contract and changed only under certain adverse circumstances. The e\\ufb00ects of changes in estimated \\ncash \\ufb02ows and discount rate assumptions on bene\\ufb01t liabilities are recorded in earnings in the period of the \\nchange. Periodic payment and annuity reinsurance contracts are regarded as limited payment contracts under \\nGAAP. We discount annuity liabilities based on the implicit rate as of the inception of the contracts such that \\nthe present value of the liabilities equals the premiums received less brokerage expense at the inception date. \\nDiscount rates for most contracts range between \\n         \\n          3\\n         % to \\n         \\n          7\\n         %. \\n(t)Regulated utilities and energy businesses \\nCertain energy subsidiaries prepare their \\ufb01nancial statements in accordance with authoritative guidance \\nfor regulated operations, re\\ufb02ecting the economic e\\ufb00ects of regulation from the ability to recover certain costs \\nfrom customers and the requirement to return revenues to customers in the future through the regulated rate-\\nsetting process. Accordingly, certain costs are deferred as regulatory assets and certain income is accrued as \\nregulatory liabilities. Regulatory assets and liabilities will be amortized into operating expenses and revenues \\nover various future periods. \\nRegulatory assets and liabilities are continually assessed for probable future inclusion in regulatory rates \\nby considering factors such as applicable regulatory or legislative changes and recent rate orders received by \\nother regulated entities. If future inclusion in regulatory rates ceases to be probable, the amount no longer \\nprobable of inclusion in regulatory rates is charged or credited to earnings (or other comprehensive income, if \\napplicable) or returned to customers. \\n(u)Foreign currency \\nThe accounts of our non-U.S.-based subsidiaries are measured, in most instances, using functional \\ncurrencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Revenues and expenses in the \\ufb01nancial statements of these subsidiaries \\nare translated into U.S. Dollars at the average exchange rate for the period and assets and liabilities are \\ntranslated at the exchange rate as of the end of the reporting period. The net e\\ufb00ects of translating the \\n\\ufb01nancial statements of these subsidiaries are included in shareholders\\u2019 equity as a component of accumulated \\nother comprehensive income. Gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in a currency other \\nthan the functional currency of the subsidiary, including gains and losses from the remeasurement of assets \\nand liabilities due to changes in currency exchange rates, are included in earnings. \\n(v)Income taxes \\nBerkshire \\ufb01les a consolidated federal income tax return in the U.S., which includes eligible subsidiaries. \\nIn addition, we \\ufb01le income tax returns in state, local and foreign jurisdictions. Provisions for current income tax \\nliabilities are calculated and accrued on income and expense amounts expected to be included in the income \\ntax returns for the current year. Income taxes reported in earnings also include deferred income tax \\nprovisions. \\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed on di\\ufb00erences between the \\ufb01nancial statement \\nbases and tax bases of assets and liabilities at the enacted tax rates. Changes in deferred income tax assets \\nand liabilities associated with components of other comprehensive income are charged or credited directly to \\nother comprehensive income. Otherwise, changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities are included as \\na component of income tax expense. The e\\ufb00ect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities attributable to \\nchanges in enacted tax rates are charged or credited to income tax expense in the period of enactment. \\nValuation allowances are established for certain deferred income tax assets when realization is not likely.\\nLiabilities are established for uncertain tax positions taken or positions expected to be taken in income \\ntax returns when such positions, in our judgment, do not meet a more-likely-than-not threshold based on the \\ntechnical merits of the positions. Estimated interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are \\nincluded as a component of income tax expense.\\nK-81 \\u00a0\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) \\n(1)Signi\\ufb01cant accounting policies and practices (Continued)\\n(w)New accounting pronouncements adopted in 2020\\nWe  adopted  Accounting Standards Codi\\ufb01cation (\\u201cASC\\u201d) 326 \\u201cFinancial Instruments-Credit Losses\\u201d on \\nJanuary 1, 2020 , which provides for the measurement of expected credit losses on \\ufb01nancial assets that are \\ncarried at amortized cost based on the net amounts expected to be collected. Measurements of expected \\ncredit losses therefore include provisions for non-collection, whether the risk is probable or remote. Upon \\nadoption of ASC 326, we recorded a charge to retained earnings of $\\n         \\n          388\\n          million representing the cumulative after-tax increase in our allowances for credit losses. \\n(x)New accounting pronouncements to be adopted subsequent to December 31, 2022 \\nIn August 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update 2018-12 \\n\\u201cTargeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts\\u201d (\\u201cASU 2018-12\\u201d). ASU 2018-12 \\nrequires reassessment of cash \\ufb02ow assumptions at least annually and revision of discount rate assumptions \\neach reporting period in valuing policyholder liabilities of long-duration insurance and reinsurance contracts. \\nDiscount rate assumptions are established based upon upper-medium grade corporate bond yields that re\\ufb02ect \\nthe duration characteristics of the liabilities. ASU 2018-12 also provides for new disclosures. Under ASU 2018-\\n12, the e\\ufb00ects from changes in cash \\ufb02ow assumptions are re\\ufb02ected in earnings and the e\\ufb00ects from changes \\nin discount rate assumptions are re\\ufb02ected in other comprehensive income. Prior to ASU 2018-12, the cash \\n\\ufb02ow and discount rate assumptions were set at the contract inception date and not subsequently changed, \\nexcept under certain adverse circumstances. ASU 2018-12 is to be applied retrospectively to the earliest \\nperiod presented in the \\ufb01nancial statements.\\nWe  adopted  ASU 2018-12 as of  January 1, 2023  using the modi\\ufb01ed retrospective method. Revised \\ncash \\ufb02ow and discount rate assumptions were applied to contracts in-force between January 1, 2021 (the \\ntransition date) and December 31, 2022 with liabilities remeasured, with the cumulative e\\ufb00ect from discount \\nrate changes (based on prevailing interest rates) recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and \\nthe cumulative e\\ufb00ect from cash \\ufb02ow assumption changes in retained earnings.\\nThe adoption of ASU 2018-12 produced a cumulative after-tax reduction in our originally reported \\nconsolidated shareholders\\u2019 equity at the end of 2020 of approximately $\\n         \\n          6.4\\n          billion (or \\n         \\n          1.4\\n         %), consisting of reductions to accumulated other comprehensive income of $\\n         \\n          5.7\\n          billion and retained earnings of $\\n         \\n          700\\n          million. The cumulative decline in shareholders\\u2019 equity decreased to approximately $\\n         \\n          4.6\\n          billion (or \\n         \\n          0.9\\n         % of the shareholders\\u2019 equity originally reported) at December 31, 2021. The cumulative e\\ufb00ect of \\nadopting ASU 2018-12 will increase our shareholders\\u2019 equity at December 31, 2022 by approximately $\\n         \\n          1.0\\n          billion. These e\\ufb00ects re\\ufb02ect the after-tax increases or decreases to our life, health and annuity bene\\ufb01ts \\nliabilities and reinsurance recoverables, primarily derived from changes in discount rate assumptions.

Since 1995, we \\nhave been party to an agreement with American Express whereby we agreed to vote a signi\\ufb01cant portion of our \\nshares in accordance with the recommendations of the American Express Board of Directors. We have also agreed \\nto passivity commitments as requested by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, which \\ncollectively, in our judgment, restrict our ability to exercise signi\\ufb01cant in\\ufb02uence over the operating and \\ufb01nancial \\npolicies of American Express. Accordingly, we do not use the equity method with respect to our investment in \\nAmerican Express common stock and we continue to record our investment at fair value. \\n(5)Equity method investments \\nBerkshire and its subsidiaries hold investments in certain businesses that are accounted for pursuant to the \\nequity method. Currently, the most signi\\ufb01cant of these are our investments in the common stock of The Kraft Heinz \\nCompany (\\u201cKraft Heinz\\u201d) and, as of August 4, 2022, Occidental.

See Note 4. \\nKraft Heinz manufactures and markets food and beverage products, including condiments and sauces, cheese \\nand dairy, meals, meats, refreshment beverages, co\\ufb00ee and other grocery products. Occidental is an international \\nenergy company, whose activities include oil and natural gas exploration, development and production, and \\nchemical manufacturing businesses.

Occidental\\u2019s \\ufb01nancial information is \\nnot available in time for concurrent reporting in our consolidated \\ufb01nancial statements. Therefore, we report the \\nequity method e\\ufb00ects for Occidental on a one-quarter lag.

As re\\ufb02ected \\nin the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, we received proceeds of approximately $\\n       \\n        33.7\\n        billion in 2022, $\\n       \\n        15.8\\n        billion in 2021 and $\\n       \\n        38.8\\n        billion in 2020 from sales of equity securities. In the preceding table, investment gains and losses on equity \\nsecurities sold during the year represent the di\\ufb00erence between the sales proceeds and the fair value of the equity \\nsecurities sold at the beginning of the applicable year or, if later, the purchase date. Our taxable gains and losses \\non equity securities sold are generally the di\\ufb00erence between the proceeds from sales and original cost. Equity \\nsecurities sold produced taxable gains of $\\n       \\n        769\\n        million in 2022, $\\n       \\n        3.6\\n        billion in 2021 and $\\n       \\n        6.2\\n        billion in 2020. \\nOur derivative contract gains and losses derived from equity index put option contracts.

For such claims, we establish and evaluate unpaid claim liabilities using standard actuarial loss \\ndevelopment methods and techniques. The actuarial methods utilize historical claims data, adjusted when deemed \\nappropriate to re\\ufb02ect perceived changes in loss patterns. Claim liabilities include average, case, case development \\nand IBNR estimates. \\nWe establish average liabilities based on expected severities for newly reported physical damage and liability \\nclaims prior to establishing individual case reserves when insu\\ufb03cient time or information is available for speci\\ufb01c \\nclaim estimates and for large volumes of minor physical damage claims that once reported are quickly settled. We \\nestablish case loss estimates for liability claims, including estimates for loss adjustment expenses, as the facts and \\nmerits of the claim are evaluated. \\nClaim estimates for liability coverages normally re\\ufb02ect greater uncertainty than physical damage coverages, \\nprimarily due to the longer claim-tails, the greater chance of litigation and the time needed to evaluate facts at the \\ntime the case estimate is \\ufb01rst established. The \\u201cclaim-tail\\u201d is the period between the claim occurrence date and \\nclaim settlement or payment date. Consequently, we establish additional case development liabilities, which are \\nusually percentages of the case liabilities. For unreported claims, IBNR liabilities are estimated by projecting the \\nultimate number of claims expected (reported and unreported) for each signi\\ufb01cant coverage and deducting \\nreported claims to produce estimated unreported claims. The product of the average cost per unreported claim and \\nthe number of unreported claims produces the IBNR liability estimate.

(Continued) \\n(16)Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (Continued)\\nBH Primary \\nBH Primary\\u2019s liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses primarily derive from medical \\nprofessional liability and workers\\u2019 compensation and other casualty insurance, which includes commercial auto and \\ngeneral liability insurance. Net incurred and paid losses and ALAE are summarized by accident year in the following \\ntables, disaggregated by medical professional liability coverages and workers\\u2019 compensation and other casualty \\ncoverages. IBNR and case development liabilities are as of December 31, 2022. The cumulative number of reported \\nclaims re\\ufb02ects the number of individual claimants and includes claims that ultimately resulted in no liability or \\npayment. Dollars are in millions. \\nMedical Professional Liability \\nWe estimate the ultimate expected incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses for medical professional \\nclaim liabilities using a variety of commonly accepted actuarial methodologies, such as the paid and incurred \\ndevelopment method and Bornhuetter-Ferguson based methods, as well as other techniques that consider insured \\nloss exposures and historical and expected loss trends, among other factors. These methodologies produce loss \\nestimates from which we determine our best estimate. In addition, we study developments in older accident years \\nand adjust initial loss estimates to re\\ufb02ect recent developments based upon claim age, coverage and litigation \\nexperience.

\\u00a0\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) \\n(16)Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (Continued)\\nWorkers\\u2019 Compensation and Other Casualty \\nWe periodically evaluate ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense estimates for the workers\\u2019 compensation \\nand other casualty claims using a combination of commonly accepted actuarial methodologies such as the \\nBornhuetter-Ferguson and chain-ladder approaches using paid and incurred loss data. Paid and incurred loss data is \\nsegregated and analyzed by state due to the di\\ufb00erent state regulatory frameworks that may impact certain factors, \\nincluding the duration and amount of loss payments. We also separately study the various components of liabilities, \\nsuch as employee lost wages, medical expenses and the costs of claims investigations and administration. We \\nestablish case liabilities for reported claims based upon the facts and circumstances of the claim. The excess of the \\nultimate projected losses, including the expected development of case estimates, and the case-basis liabilities is \\nincluded in IBNR liabilities.

property and casualty claims liabilities. \\nThese methodologies include paid and incurred loss development techniques, incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-\\nFerguson techniques and frequency and severity techniques, as well as ground-up techniques when appropriate. \\nOur claims liabilities are principally a function of reported losses from ceding companies, case development \\nand IBNR liability estimates. Case loss estimates are reported under our contracts either individually or in bulk as \\nprovided under the terms of the contracts. We may independently evaluate case losses reported by the ceding \\ncompany, and if deemed appropriate, we may establish case liabilities based on our estimates.\\nK-96 \\u00a0\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) \\n(16)Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (Continued)\\nEstimated IBNR liabilities are a\\ufb00ected by expected case loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios, \\nwhich are evaluated as groups of contracts with similar exposures or on a contract-by-contract basis. Estimated \\ncase and IBNR liabilities for major catastrophe events are generally based on a per-contract assessment of the \\nultimate cost associated with the individual loss event. Claim count data is not provided consistently by ceding \\ncompanies under our contracts or is otherwise considered unreliable. \\nNet incurred and paid losses and ALAE of BHRG are disaggregated based on losses that are expected to have \\nshorter claim-tails (property) and losses expected to have longer claim-tails (casualty). Under certain contracts, the \\ncoverage can apply to multiple lines of business written by the ceding company, whether property, casualty or \\ncombined, and the ceding company may not report loss data by such lines consistently, if at all.

We believe that analysis of \\nlosses incurred and paid by accident year of the underlying event is irrelevant given that our exposure to losses \\nincepts when the contract incepts and that the classi\\ufb01cation of reported claims and case development liabilities has \\nlittle or no practical analytical value. Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses in the Consolidated Statements \\nof Earnings include changes in estimated liabilities and related deferred charge asset amortization and adjustments \\narising from the changes in estimated timing and amount of future loss payments. Unamortized deferred charges  related to retroactive reinsurance contracts were $\\n       \\n        9.9\\n        billion at December 31, 2022 and $\\n       \\n        10.6\\n        billion at December 31, 2021.\\nPaid losses and loss adjustment expenses include claim payments attributable to a contract between our \\nsubsidiary, National Indemnity Company, and certain subsidiaries of American International Group, Inc. \\n(collectively, \\u201cAIG\\u201d). Claim payments under the AIG contract commenced in 2021 and were $\\n       \\n        1.5\\n        billion in 2022 and $\\n       \\n        1.2\\n        billion in 2021. Our estimated unpaid claim liabilities with regard to the AIG contract were approximately $\\n       \\n        13.9\\n        billion at December 31, 2022 and $\\n       \\n        15.8\\n        billion at December 31, 2021. \\nIn establishing retroactive reinsurance claim liabilities, we analyze historical aggregate loss payment patterns \\nand project losses into the future under various probability-weighted scenarios. We expect the claim-tail to be very \\nlong for many contracts, with some lasting several decades. We monitor claim payment activity and review ceding \\ncompany reports and other information concerning the underlying losses. We reassess and revise the expected \\ntiming and amounts of ultimate losses periodically or when signi\\ufb01cant events are revealed through our monitoring \\nand review processes. \\nEstimated claim liabilities for retroactive reinsurance included estimates for environmental, asbestos and \\nother latent injury exposures of approximately $\\n       \\n        12.1\\n        billion at December 31, 2022 and $\\n       \\n        12.3\\n        billion at December 31, 2021. Retroactive reinsurance contracts are generally subject to aggregate policy \\nlimits and thus, our exposure to such claims under these contracts is likewise limited. We monitor evolving case law \\nand its e\\ufb00ect on environmental and other latent injury claims. Changing laws or government regulations, newly \\nidenti\\ufb01ed toxins, newly reported claims, new theories of liability, new contract interpretations and other factors \\ncould result in increases in these liabilities, which could be material to our results of operations.

The  2012  and \\n2013  tax years are under review by the IRS\\u2019s Independent O\\ufb03ce of Appeals, and the IRS is currently auditing tax \\nyears  2014  through  2019 .

The remaining balance in net \\nunrecognized tax bene\\ufb01ts principally relates to tax positions where the ultimate recognition is highly certain but \\nthere is uncertainty about the timing of recognition. Because of the impact of deferred income tax accounting, \\nthese positions, when recognized, would not a\\ufb00ect the annual e\\ufb00ective income tax rate.

measurements (Continued) \\nThe fair values of substantially all of our \\ufb01nancial instruments were measured using market or income \\napproaches. The hierarchy for measuring fair value consists of Levels 1 through 3, which are described below. \\nLevel 1 \\u2013 Inputs represent unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in active \\nmarkets. \\nLevel 2 \\u2013 Inputs include directly or indirectly observable inputs (other than Level 1 inputs) such as \\nquoted prices for similar assets or liabilities exchanged in active or inactive markets; quoted prices for \\nidentical assets or liabilities exchanged in inactive markets; other inputs that may be considered in fair value \\ndeterminations of the assets or liabilities, such as interest rates and yield curves, volatilities, prepayment \\nspeeds, loss severities, credit risks and default rates; and inputs that are derived principally from or \\ncorroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Pricing evaluations generally re\\ufb02ect \\ndiscounted expected future cash \\ufb02ows, which incorporate yield curves for instruments with similar \\ncharacteristics, such as credit ratings, estimated durations and yields for other instruments of the issuer or \\nentities in the same industry sector. \\nLevel 3 \\u2013 Inputs include unobservable inputs used in the measurement of assets and liabilities. \\nManagement is required to use its own assumptions regarding unobservable inputs because there is little, if \\nany, market activity in the assets or liabilities and it may be unable to corroborate the related observable \\ninputs. Unobservable inputs require management to make certain projections and assumptions about the \\ninformation that would be used by market participants in valuing assets or liabilities. \\nReconciliations of signi\\ufb01cant assets and liabilities measured and carried at fair value on a recurring basis with \\nthe use of signi\\ufb01cant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for each of the three years ending December 31, 2022 follow (in \\nmillions). \\n\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0Balance at\\nbeginning\\nof year \\u00a0\\u00a0Gains \\n(losses) \\nincluded in \\nearnings\\u00a0\\u00a0Acquisition\\ns,\\ndisposition\\ns\\nand\\nsettlement\\ns \\u00a0\\u00a0Transfers \\nout of Level \\n3 \\u00a0\\u00a0Balance at \\nDecember \\n31, \\u00a0\\nInvestments in equity securities: \\u00a0 \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u00a0\\u00a0\\n2022\\n\\u00a0$             \\n              \\n11,480\\n             \\u00a0\\u00a0$             \\n              \\n689\\n             \\u00a0\\u00a0$ \\u2014\\u00a0\\u00a0$ \\u2014\\u00a0\\u00a0$             \\n              \\n12,169\\n             \\u00a0\\n2021\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0             \\n              \\n8,978\\n             \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0             \\n              \\n1,902\\n             \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0             \\n              \\n1,100\\n             \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0(\\n             \\n              \\n500\\n             )\\u00a0\\u00a0             \\n              \\n11,480\\n             \\u00a0\\n2020\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0             \\n              \\n10,405\\n             \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0(\\n             \\n              \\n1,426\\n             )\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u2014\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0(\\n             \\n              \\n1\\n             )\\u00a0\\u00a0             \\n              \\n8,978\\n             \\u00a0\\n\\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u00a0\\u00a0\\nEquity index put option contract liabilities: \\u00a0 \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u00a0\\u00a0\\n2021\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0(\\n             \\n              \\n1,065\\n             )\\u00a0\\u00a0             \\n              \\n966\\n             \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u2014\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0             \\n              \\n99\\n             \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u2014\\u00a0\\n2020\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0(\\n             \\n              \\n968\\n             )\\u00a0\\u00a0(\\n             \\n              \\n159\\n             )\\u00a0\\u00a0             \\n              \\n62\\n             \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u2014\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0(\\n             \\n              \\n1,065\\n             )\\n\\u00a0\\nQuantitative information as of December 31, 2022 for the signi\\ufb01cant assets measured and carried at fair value \\non a recurring basis with the use of signi\\ufb01cant unobservable inputs (Level 3) follows (in millions). \\n\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0 \\u00a0Fair\\nValue \\u00a0\\u00a0Principal\\nValuation\\nTechniques \\u00a0Unobservable\\nInputs \\u00a0Weighted\\nAverage\\nInvestments in equity \\nsecurities: \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0\\nPreferred stock \\u00a0$\\n             \\n              \\u00a0\\u00a0Discounted cash \\ufb02ow\\u00a0Expected duration \\u00a0\\n             \\n              6  9,964\\n             years\\n             \\n\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0 \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u00a0\\u00a0Discount for transferability \\nrestrictions and \\nsubordination \\u00a0             \\n              372\\n             \\u00a0bps\\n\\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u00a0\\u00a0\\nCommon stock warrants \\u00a0\\u00a0             \\n              \\n2,205\\n             \\u00a0\\u00a0Warrant pricing \\nmodel \\u00a0Expected duration \\u00a0             \\n              6 \\nyears\\n             \\n\\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u00a0Volatility \\u00a0             \\n              39\\n             %\\n\\u00a0\\nK-104 \\u00a0\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) \\n(20) Fair value measurements (Continued)\\nInvestments in equity securities in the preceding table include our investments in certain preferred and \\ncommon stock warrants that do not have readily determinable market values as de\\ufb01ned under GAAP.

Average equivalent Class B shares outstanding \\nrepresents average Class B shares outstanding plus \\n       \\n        1,500\\n        times average Class A shares outstanding. \\nBerkshire\\u2019s common stock repurchase program, as amended, permits Berkshire to repurchase shares any time \\nthat Warren Bu\\ufb00ett, Berkshire\\u2019s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive O\\ufb03cer, and Charlie Munger, Vice \\nChairman of the Board, believe that the repurchase price is below Berkshire\\u2019s intrinsic value, conservatively \\ndetermined.  The program continues to allow share repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated \\ntransactions and does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. However, repurchases will not \\nbe made if they would reduce the total value of Berkshire\\u2019s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury \\nBill holdings below $\\n       \\n        30\\n        billion. The repurchase program does not obligate Berkshire to repurchase any speci\\ufb01c dollar amount or \\nnumber of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the program. \\nK-105 \\u00a0\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) \\n(22)Revenues from contracts with customers\\nWe recognize revenue when a good or service is transferred to a customer. A good or service is transferred \\nwhen or as the customer obtains control of that good or service. Revenues are based on the consideration we \\nexpect to receive in connection with our promises to deliver goods and services to our customers.  The following \\ntables summarize customer contract revenues disaggregated by reportable segment and the source of the revenue \\nfor each of the three years ended December 31, 2022 (in millions). Other revenues, which are not considered to be \\nrevenues from contracts with customers under GAAP, are primarily insurance premiums earned, interest, dividend \\nand other investment income and leasing revenues.\\n\\u00a0\\n2022 \\u00a0Manufact\\nuring\\u00a0\\u00a0McLane\\u00a0\\u00a0Service

    \\n        132.3\\n        billion in 2020. Sales, service and leasing revenues attributable to the United States were \\n       \\n        86\\n       % in 2022, \\n       \\n        85\\n       % in 2021 and \\n       \\n        86\\n       % in 2020 of such amounts. The remainder of sales, service and leasing revenues were primarily in Europe, \\nCanada and the Asia Paci\\ufb01c region. Railroad, utilities and energy revenues were $\\n       \\n        52.1\\n        billion in 2022, $\\n       \\n        48.2\\n        billion in 2021 and $\\n       \\n        41.8\\n        billion in 2020. In each of the three years, approximately \\n       \\n        \\n         \\n          96\\n         \\n        \\n       % of such revenues were attributable to the United States. At December 31, 2022, approximately \\n       \\n        90\\n       % of our consolidated net property, plant and equipment and equipment held for lease was located in the \\nUnited States with the remainder primarily in Canada and the United Kingdom. \\n(26)Contingencies and Commitments \\nWe are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including \\nlegal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance \\ncontracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plainti\\ufb00s occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not \\nbelieve that such normal and routine litigation will have a material e\\ufb00ect on our \\ufb01nancial condition or results of \\noperations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which \\nassert or may assert claims or seek to impose \\ufb01nes and penalties. We currently believe that any liability that may \\narise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material e\\ufb00ect on our consolidated \\ufb01nancial condition \\nor results of operations. \\nOur subsidiaries regularly make commitments in the ordinary course of business for the future purchase of \\ngoods and services used in their businesses, which are not yet re\\ufb02ected in our Consolidated Financial Statements. \\nThe most signi\\ufb01cant of our long-term commitments relate to our railroad, utilities and energy businesses, our \\nshared aircraft ownership and leasing business and certain raw materials purchase commitments. As of December \\n31, 2022, estimated future payments under those arrangements were as follows: $\\n       \\n        12\\n        billion in 2023, $\\n       \\n        5\\n        billion in 2024, $\\n       \\n        3\\n        billion in 2025, $\\n       \\n        2\\n        billion in 2026, $\\n       \\n        2         billion in 2027 and $\\n       \\n        18\\n        billion after 2027.\\nSince October 2017, we have owned a \\n       \\n        38.6\\n       % interest in Pilot, headquartered in Knoxville, Tennessee. Pilot is the largest operator of travel centers in North \\nAmerica (primarily under the names Pilot or Flying J) with more than \\n       \\n        650\\n        travel center locations across \\n       \\n        44\\n        U.S. states and \\n       \\n        six\\n        Canadian provinces. Pilot also has over \\n       \\n        150\\n        retail locations in the U.S. and Canada where it sells diesel fuel through various arrangements with third party \\ntravel centers. Through December 31, 2022, we accounted for our investment in Pilot under the equity method and \\nthe carrying value of our investment was $\\n       \\n        3.2\\n        billion as of December 31, 2022. On January 31, 2023, we acquired an additional \\n       \\n        41.4\\n       % interest for approximately $\\n       \\n        8.2\\n        billion. This amount is based on a contractual agreement that is dependent on Pilot\\u2019s earnings for 2022 and its \\nnet debt at the end of 2022, and is subject to post-closing adjustments following the completion of Pilot\\u2019s \\nindependent public accountant\\u2019s audit of its 2022 \\ufb01nancial statements. We obtained control of Pilot for \\ufb01nancial \\nreporting purposes on January 31, 2023 and, consequently, we will discontinue the use of the equity method and \\ninclude Pilot\\u2019s \\ufb01nancial statements in our Consolidated Financial Statements at that date. \\nIn applying the acquisition method of accounting, we are required to remeasure our previously held \\n       \\n        38.6\\n       % interest in Pilot to fair value as of January 31, 2023. The excess of the fair value of that interest over the \\ncarrying value under the equity method will be recorded as a remeasurement gain. \\nGiven the proximity of the acquisition date of the additional Pilot interest to the date these Consolidated \\nFinancial Statements are issued, it was impracticable to provide an initial estimate of the fair values of identi\\ufb01able \\nassets acquired, liabilities assumed and residual goodwill or proforma information. We expect to provide such \\ndisclosures in our Consolidated Financial Statements beginning with our interim report for the quarterly period \\nending March 31, 2023. \\nWe may be obligated to acquire certain noncontrolling interests in less-than-wholly-owned subsidiaries in the \\nfuture, pursuant to the terms of agreements with the noncontrolling shareholders for cash or other assets. The \\ntiming and the amount of any future payments that might be required to such noncontrolling shareholders are \\ncontingent on future actions of the noncontrolling owners and the value of the interest being acquired. \\nIn June 2022, BHE acquired the BHE common stock held by Gregory Abel, Berkshire\\u2019s Vice Chairman - non-\\ninsurance operations, for $\\n       \\n        870\\n        million. The purchase was pursuant to the terms of a shareholder agreement between Berkshire, BHE and \\nBHE\\u2019s noncontrolling shareholders. Berkshire recorded a charge of $\\n       \\n        362\\n        million to capital in excess of par value for the excess of the consideration paid over the carrying value of the \\nacquired noncontrolling interest.\\nK-113 \\u00a0\\nItem 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure \\nNone \\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures \\nAt the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Corporation carried out an \\nevaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Corporation\\u2019s management, including the \\nChairman (Chief Executive O\\ufb03cer) and the Senior Vice President (Chief Financial O\\ufb03cer), of the e\\ufb00ectiveness of the \\ndesign and operation of the Corporation\\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-\\n15.
